In the spirit of open science, I want to make my research as accessible as possible. This webpage is a tool for disseminating my thesis research in a format that is more user-friendly than a 100-page, double-spaced PDF file. The materials were submitted to the University Graduate School of UT Austin on December 8, 2017 in fullfillment of the requirments for a Ph.D. degree.
