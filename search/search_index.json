How do we remember places we have visited before? How do we remember our experiences in those places? These questions of learning, memory, and behavior apply to our everyday lives and can be studied rigorously with cellular and molecular approaches. Learning is influenced by many different biological timescales - physiological time via effects on brain activity through neural circuits, developmental via changes that effect genome modification and development, and evolutionary, via the processes that shape natural selection. Neurons differ from one another in many ways: structurally, functionally and genetically, as well as the connections they make with other cells. Diversity in neuronal structure and function is a striking sources of variability in organisms with nervous systems and gives rise to complex behavior and cognition4. The mammalian hippocampus is a crucial brain system for processing and storing neural representations of complex information that includes memory, context, space, and time5,6. The extent to which gene expression accounts for the functional and characteristics of cell types, neural systems, and behavioral expression is unknown despite being fundamental to many research programs in biology and medicine. Understanding how such cellular variability in the brain gives rise to phenotypical variation is of utmost importance for advancing neuroscience and related fields7, yet we remain na\u00efve about what is and is not stable. One goal of modern neuroscience is to fully characterize the structure and function of all the molecules in all the neurons in all the circuits of the human brain8,9, and a goal of modern biologists is sequence all the genes in all the tissues of millions of organisms. Generations of behavioral neuroscientists have developed highly-sophisticated paradigms for taking a reductionists approach to neuroscience5,6,10\u201314. NEURO-GENOMIC APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING BRAIN FUNCTION \u00b6 On the other hand, the fields of data science and neurogenomics explore complex interactions among genotypes, phenotypes, and the environment by conducting large-scale studies with multiple hypotheses testing and data-driven discovery of unknown biological processes. Neurogenomics is a collaborative, interdisciplinary, integrative field of study that unites diverse expertise, techniques, theories, and approaches to shed new lights on complex biological processes. Integrating data from data-driven collection platforms like high-throughput sequencing and real-time behavioral tracking provides additional insight into how neural systems work. Conducting reproducible research in an open science environment can make this approach even more powerful. Large-scale transcriptomic studies have uncovered patterns of gene networks that reflect the biological phenotype15,16. Therefore, one of the advantages of using genome-scale transcriptomic tools, such as RNA-seq to study variability and plasticity is that the activity of the entire genome can be studied at once, and the genes can be classified according to their responses to specific manipulations and environmental variables. Genes that respond to environmental or experimental cue can be identified, and their biological and genomic characteristics studied, resulting in the analysis of higher-order biological processes linked to phenotypic variability17\u201319. Our understanding of the molecular processes underlying neuronal individuality and plasticity is still insufficient and made all the more difficult because we now know that experience changes gene expression, which itself changes neural function and thus the subsequent neural functions in future experience20\u201322. Transcriptomic analyses examining sub-fields of the hippocampus (or the whole hippocampus) have shed light on proximate mechanisms regulating learning and memory23\u201328. However, the hippocampus and the CA1 subfield are composed of multiple morphologically and functionally distinct cell classes, which may make whole hippocampus samples poor estimates of the molecular activity patterns in learning-recruited neurons. How representative are hippocampal patterns of gene expression compared to single-neuron patterns of molecular activity? While imaging and molecular genetic tools have long complemented single cell electrophysiological analyses, it has now also become possible to conduct molecular level analyses on a single neuron level20. RNA-sequencing technology has advanced sufficiently in recent years to conduct single-cell transcriptomic projects. Indeed, several proof-of-principle studies demonstrating feasibility and robustness have been published. We will take both single neuron and hippocampal CA1 tissue samples to identify the extent to which patterns of variability are preserved across these two levels of analysis. RESEARCH APPROACH \u00b6 For my thesis, I use an integrative approach to fill a gap in our understanding of how the outward expression of learning and memory is controlled by cellular mechanisms in the brain (Fig 0.2). In Chapter 1, I will research how avoidance behaviors are regulated by molecular changes that alter the synaptic activity in a hippocampal circuit. My null hypothesis is that there is no difference in subfield specific response of hippocampal transcriptomes to conditioned place avoidance memory. The detection of subfield-specific changes in gene expression while shedding new light on our understanding of functional changes subservient to memory underlying changes in behavior. In Chapter 2, I will examine the effects of genetic manipulation the fragile x mental retardation gene (Fmr1) on avoidance behavior, synaptic physiology in a hippocampal circuit, and gene expression in hippocampal subfields. Fmr1recieves a lot of attention from the autism research community, but much of the work has focused on translational or downstream effects, given FMRPs know role in regulating synaptic translation. The present research will provide a systems view of genetic manipulation that may provide insight for improved precision of tool for molecular and genetic manipulation of organisms. In Chapter 3, I will examine transcriptional activity in hippocampal subfields in response behavioral and technical manipulations. A well-designed behavioral paradigm allows me to explore the effect subtlety different learning experiences on neuromolecular activity.

I aimed to fill that gap by asking, \u201cHow do memory-associated place avoidance and cognitive discrimination alter gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus?\u201d. This research required an interdisciplinary approach to utilize both the hypothesis-driven techniques of behavioral neuroscience and the discovery-driven methods of behavioral genomics to identify novel neuromolecular substrates of memory. I found that gene expression in CA1 and DG discriminates internal versus external variables because yoked and trained mice had the identical physical experience of the world but could interpret the experience differently. I observed that different gene functions and patterns of differential expression in the hippocampal subfields. DG most responsive to memory formation, and all the upregulated genes are known to be involved nuclear signaling; while changes in CA1 reflect membrane-level ion-channel regulation. The CA1 results also demonstrate sensitivity to the amount of unavoidable shock or stress that occurred 24h in the past, which could be a molecular signature for a form of stress-related memory. Finally, the results demonstrated that conflict learning does not cause additional gene expression changes relative to initial learning. The strength of this research is its collaborative, integrative, and reproducible approaches that provide a deeper understanding of the molecular changes that are or are not associated with robust behavioral output indicative of memory. INTRODUCTION \u00b6 For centuries, scientists and philosophers have sought to understand how the brain uses memory to drive changes in behavior. One challenge is that memory cannot be physically isolated. Memory is an instance in which an organism's current behavior is determined by some aspect of its previous experience30. It an emergent property that researchers observe as an overt change at one or more levels of biological organization. Recent advances in molecular biology and neuroscience pushed our understanding past the concept of the neural doctrine (single neurons are the brain\u2019s information processing unit of organization) and the central dogma of molecular biology (function is coded by the process DNA->RNA->Protein) which alone do not solve the problem of understanding how the brain stores and recalls memories that change animal behavior. Neurons differ from one another in many ways: structurally, functionally and genetically, as well as the connections they make with other cells. The extent to which gene expression accounts for the function and characteristics of cell types, neural systems, and behavioral expression is unknown despite being fundamental to many research programs in biology and medicine. One goal of modern neuroscience is to fully characterize the structure and function of all the molecules in all the neurons in all the circuits of the human brain (8,9 but see 7,31). Additionally, understanding how such variability and plasticity in the brain gives rise to emergent phenotypical variation is of utmost importance for advancing neuroscience and related fields. Generations of behavioral neuroscientists have developed sophisticated paradigms for assessing the biological correlates of memory and cognition14. However, it can be a challenge to interpret the significance of observed behavior differences. \u201cThe problem with rats is that I can't ask them if they remember what they had for breakfast,\u201d Howard Eichenbaum once said32. Nevertheless, community-developed standards were established such that robust behavioral phenotypes could be used as indicators of memory-associated changes in behavior. Memory is a term used to characterize instances in which an organism's current behavior is determined by some aspect of its previous experience30. In active avoidance paradigms, the focal animal is required to emit a specific response in order to escape or avoid a noxious stimulus33. Thus, avoidance behavior is a readable outcome of memory. The hippocampus is widely known to be involved in spatial navigation, learning, and memory5. In 1909, Cajal illustrated the hippocampus with directional connections between neurons between the entorhinal cortex (EC), subregions of Cornu Ammonius' Ammon's horn (CA) and the dentate gyrus (DG), with information flowing from in the EC -> CA1 -> CA3 -> DG -> EC or through additional pathways that skip subfields or layers within subfields34. In 1971, John O'Keefe found that place cells in the hippocampus function as an internal global positions system (GPS) in our brain5,6. Different place cells are active when an animal is in different locations within the environment35. In the 2000s, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser demonstrated the place cells of the CA1 were connected to grid cells of the entorhinal cortex11. The CA1 pyramidal cells are often referred to as place cells because they activate when an animal is in a particular place in its environment. The CA3-CA1 synapse has received a lot of attention for long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and other forms of synaptic plasticity as it might relate to learning. The DG has been given some attention for adult-born neurogenesis and its role in learning and memory36\u201339. Since the early 80s with discoveries that the NMDA receptor and Calcium-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) play crucial roles in LTP, neuroscientists have been using pharmacology to identify the molecular and neural substrates of synaptic plasticity and memory. These studies linked changes in behavior to long-term potentiation, long-term depression, and the expression of numerous candidate genes40,41. Molecular and cellular biologists have shed light on what molecules serve as biomarkers for cells with different structure and function42\u201344. This tools have highlighted the heterogeneity of the structure and function of neurons and have lead to new hypothesis regarding how different neuron classes contribute to cognition. Modern genomic techniques such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing have made it possible to examine the molecular underpinnings of plasticity in animal behavior18,45\u201347. Yet despite its successes in generating discovery-driven insights, behavioral genomics has been criticized for its lack hypotheses48. Additionally, databases of gene expression for mouse hippocampi do exists49\u201353, but they provide little insight into how dynamic activity of transcriptome supports memory. The goal of this research is to marry the hypothesis-driven techniques of behavioral neuroscience with the discovery-driven methods of behavioral genomics to identify novel neuromolecular substrates of memory. First, I analyzed the behavior of mice in a task explicitly designed to test how the brain uses spatial information for memory processing. My experiment used a variant of the active place avoidance task33,36,54\u201356 which allowed us to tease apart the effects of subtle differences in an animal's experience of the environment. Then, I characterized the transcriptional pattern of activity from tissue samples from the DG-CA3-CA1 tri-synaptic pathway that has been implicated in spatial learning and memory. The results of this work showed that this work confirms previously identified sub-field specific patterns of expression and confirms previous descriptions of candidate memory gene activity in CA1. Importantly, I also detected novel patterns of transcription factor activation in the DG and a surprising lack of transcriptional plasticity in CA3. These two findings suggest new mechanisms for how information flows through a DG-CA3-CA1 pathway that has been implicated in memory. The results provide a unique perspective on the role of transcriptional stability and plasticity about hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. In the spirit of reproducible research and open science57\u201360, all data, code, and results are publically available and licensed under a creative commons for reuse for the continued advancement of basic research. MATERIAL & METHODS \u00b6 All animal care and use complies with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the New York University Animal Welfare Committee and the Marine Biological Laboratory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at the Marine Biological Laboratory on a 12:12 (light: dark) cycle with continuous access to food and water in home cages with up to five littermates. The Active Place Avoidance Task \u00b6 To examine spatial learning and memory, we used a well-established active place avoidance paradigm36,54,61. Littermates were randomly assigned to one of our treatment groups (nyoked-consistent=8, nconsistent=8, nyoked-conflict=9, nconflict=9). All mice were exposed to nine sessions in the active place avoidance arena (Fig. 1.1A). Mice were placed on an elevated circular 40-cm diameter arena that rotated at 1 rpm. The arena wall was transparent and thus contained the mice to the arena while allowing it to observe the environment. The location of the mouse in the arena was determined from an overhead television camera a PC-controlled tracking system (Bio-Signal Group). Consistently trained mice in the active place avoidance task are conditioned to avoid mild shocks (constant current 0.2 mA 500 ms 60 Hz) that can be localized by visual cues in the environment. Yoked mice are delivered a sequence of unavoidable shocks that reproduces the time series of shocks received by the trained mice; however, the shocks delivered to the mice cannot be localized by visual cues in the environment. All sessions in the arena last 10 minutes. Mice are allowed to become familiar with walking on a rotating arena during a 10 min pretraining session. Then mice undergo 3, 10-min avoidance training sessions separated by a 2 h inter-trial interval. Mice are returned to their home cage overnight. The next day, mice are subjected to a 10-min \u2018Retest session\u2019 where the shock is in the same location as before. For the next three training sessions, the shock zone remains in the same place for consistently trained animals, but it is rotated 180\u00b0 for the conflict-trained mice. The next day, all mice are subjected to a 1-min \u201cRetention session\u201d with the shock off. Statistical analyses of behavior \u00b6 Place avoidance was evaluated by end-point measures output by TrackAnalysis software. Forty quantitative variables were measured that capture the animals\u2019 use of space and time. The two estimates of place avoidance used were the reduction in entrances into the shock zone and the increased time to stay out of the shock zone. A repeated measures ANOVA with sphericity correction was used to identify group differences in behavioral measure across all training sessions62,63. A two-way ANOVA was used to compare the mean difference between conflict and consistently trained mice during a single training session62. The non-parametric Kendall's tau statistic was used to estimate a rank-based measure of correlation between the number of entrances and maximum avoidance time62. Fig. 1.1: Experimental design. A) Mice were assigned to one of four groups: consistently-trained (red, n=8), yoked-consistent (dark grey, n=8), conflict-trained (peach, n=9), or yoked-conflict (light grey, n=9). Mice were placed on the rotating arena (1 rpm) for training sessions that lasted 10 min and was separated by 2-hour intersession interval or overnight (~17 hr). Behavior was recorded during the Pre-training, Training (T1-T6), Retest, and Retention session. In the active place avoidance schematics, the shaded pie-shaped region is the behaviorally relevant region used for counting the number of entrances into the shock zone. The shocking of yoked mice is not spatially limited to the dark-grey pie-shaped zone, but consistent and conflict trained mice only receive shocks in the red and peach-shaded regions, respectively.

C) Graphical illustration of hippocampal tissues sequenced and sample sizes for each treatment group and hippocampal subfield. \u00b6 Tissue preparation from DG, CA3, and CA1 subfields \u00b6 Thirty minutes after the last cognitive training session, mice were anesthetized with 2% (vol/vol) isoflurane for 2 minutes and decapitated. Transverse 300 \u03bcm brain slices were cut using a vibratome (model VT1000 S, Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) and incubated at 36\u00b0C for 30 min and then at room temperature for 90 min in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4 and 25 Glucose) 64,65. The DG, CA3, CA1 subfields were microdissected using a 0.25 mm punch (Electron Microscopy Systems) and a Zeiss dissecting scope (Fig. 1B). RNA was isolated using the Maxwell 16 LEV RNA Isolation Kit (Promega). RNA libraries were prepared by the Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Facility at the University of Texas at Austin and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics \u00b6 Raw reads were from the transferred from the GSAF to the Stampede Cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Facility (TACC) via Amazon Cloud. Quality of the data was checked using the program FASTQC66 and visualized using MultiQC67. Samples sizes for each treatment group and subfield are reported in Figure 1C. I obtained a median number of 7.3 million reads per samples, with a maximum of 37 million and a minimum of 1.5 million reads. Next, I used the program Kallisto68 for pseudo-alignment of raw reads to a mouse references transcriptome (Gencode version 7)69. A median number of 2.25 million reads were pseudo-aligned to the references transcriptome. To confirm that Kallisto performed well on raw reads, I also removed low-quality reads and contaminating adapter sequences using the program Cutadapt70, but these trimmed and filtered reads yield less than 1 million mapped reads for all but 3 of the 44 samples; therefore all subsequent analyses were conducted on the pseudo-aligned raw reads. Statistics and data visualization of RNA-sequencing data \u00b6 Transcript counts from Kallisto were imported into R62 and aggregated to yield gene counts using the \u2018gene\u2019 identifier from the Gencode transcriptome. I used DESeq271 to normalize and quantify gene counts with a false discovery corrected (FDR) p-value < 0.1. The DESeq2 models including subfield (DG, CA3, CA1), training group (yoked-consistent, consistent, yoked-conflict, and conflict) and their interaction. Hierarchical clustering by correlation and volcano plots were used to visualize the patterns of differential gene expression71\u201376. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and ANOVAs were used to test for group differences in the principal components. A chi-squared goodness of fit test was used to test for equal distribution of up- and down-regulated gene expression between two-way contrasts62. I used GO_MWU77 to identify gene ontology categories using a -log(p-value) as a continuous measure of significance that are significantly enriched with either up- or down-regulated genes for a given two-way contrast. I used ggplot276, cowplot75, pheatmap78, viridis79, ColorBrewer72, and colorblindr80 to make figures that are (hopefully) color-blind friendly. Multi-panel figures and illustrations were created using Adobe Illustrator. Archival of data, code, and results \u00b6 I archived the raw sequence data and intermediate data files in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus Database (accession: GSE99765). The data and code are publically available on GitHub with a stable version archived at Zenodo 81. RESULTS \u00b6 Conflict- and consistently-trained mice exhibit place avoidance Active place avoidance is evidenced by a reduction in the mean number of entrances into the shock zone (F(24,240) = 5.140, p = 5.57e-08) (Fig. 1.2A). Place avoidance is also evidenced by an increase in the time the mouse stays out of the conditioned shock zone, as illustrated by time to the second entrance (F(24,240) = 5.30, p = 2.20e-09) (Fig. 1.2B). These two measures of behavior (number of entrances and time to second entrance) are inversely correlated (tau\uf074=-0.55, p < 2.2e-16). A principal component analysis of all the quantitative variables shows that the two measures load strongly onto PC1, which is significantly different between treatments groups (F3=70.92, p = 1.01e-13) (Fig. 1.2C). In fact, most of the quantitative measures captured by the video tracking software are positively or negatively correlated with the measures of shock zone entrances or avoidance, as evidenced by a hierarchical clustering analysis (Fig. 1.2C). Notably, measures of speed are not correlated with place avoidance, but there is a pattern that speed is highest during the pre-training session compared to the later sessions. Fig. 1.2: Cognitive training alters spatial approach and avoidance behavior. A) Consistently trained (red lines) mice make fewer entrances into the shock zone than yoked-mice (dark grey lines) on all training (T1-T6), restest, and retention (Reten.) sessions but not during the pre-training session (Pre.). Conflict-trained mice (peach) and their yoked controls (light grey) show a similar pattern except for that mean number of differences between T1 and T4 do not differ between conflict-trained mice. B) Time to second shock zone entrance shows a pattern that is reciprocal to the mean number of entrances. C) A principal component analysis estimates that cognitive training explains 36% of the observed variation in behavior (red and peach versus dark grey and light grey). Among the top five contributing variables are the number of entrances and the max avoidance time. D) Hierarchical clustering by correlation of 40 behaviors shows that approach, latency to approach (or avoidance), and speed are primary behavioral variables captured by our video-tracking software. Clustering distinguishes trained and yoked animals but does not provide precise temporal resolution. The color scale shows centered z-s for high (yellow) and low (deep purple) values for each quantitative variable. For code see Github . \u00b6 Conflict-trained mice exhibit cognitive discrimination \u00b6 Cognitive discrimination requires distinguishing between similar but distinct experiences. I investigated cognitive discrimination by changing the location of shock. Conflict-trained and consistently-trained mice differ in the mean number of entrances during the T4/C1 session (F(1) =17.49, p=0.000801), but not during the T6/C3 session (F(1) = 0.265, p=0.614) (Fig. 1.2A). These results indicate that, with continued training, the conflict mice rapidly learned to discriminate between the memories of the old and new shock locations. Fig. 1.3: Subfield differences in hippocampal gene expression \u00b6 A) I compared gene expression in three hippocampal subfields from our four treatment groups (DG: orange, CA3: green, CA1: purple, yoked-consistent: filled circle, consistent: open square, yoked-conflict: filled square, conflict: open square). B) Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes shows variation between subfields is much greater than variation induced by treatment. C) A principal component analysis estimates that over 50 % of the variation is capture in PC1 and P3, which visually separate the three hippocampal subfields. D) 3000 are differentially expressed in a symmetric pattern between DG and CA. E, F) Fewer genes are up-regulated in CA1 compared to both DG and CA3, but the magnitude of expression differences in greater between DG-CA1 than between CA3-CA1. For volcano plots, dots are partially transparent to aid visualization of density. For code see Github . \u00b6 Confirmation of subfield-specific gene expression patterns \u00b6 Large differences in subfield specific gene expression are well documented49\u201353, but the association of memory and gene expression is understudied. Thus, I examined broad patterns of gene expression variation in DG, CA3, and CA1 tissue samples from mice in each of the four cognitive training groups (Fig. 1.1C, Table 1.2A). My results confirm previous studies by showing significant differences in gene expression of thousands of genes between brain regions (Fig. 1.3). Hierarchical clustering of the top 250 differentially expressed genes at FDR 0.1 reveals a strong signature of subfield-specific expression, with all samples clustering by subfield (Fig. 1.3B). PC1 and PC2 account for 71% of the variation and are both significantly different between subfields (PC1 - F2:41=256.2, p << 0.001; PC2 - F2:41=1030, p << 0.001). PC6 explains only 1% of the variation in gene expression it does vary according to cognitive training (F3:40=12.01, p<<0.001). Hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses are a convenient way to visualize gene expression differences between all samples, but volcano plots are a convenient way to explore two-way contrasts in more detail. The contrast between brain regions highlights the magnitude of differential expression between subfields (DG vs. CA3: 3145, DG vs. CA1: 2526, CA3 vs. CA1: 2022 differentially expressed genes at FDR=0.1). The distribution differential gene expression is symmetrical between CA3 and DG (Fig 1.3D). Fewer genes that half the differentially expressed genes are up-regulated in CA1 compared to DG (Fig 1.3E) and CA3 (Fig 1.3F), but the magnitude of expression differences in greater between DG-CA1 (Fig 1.3F). Research question 1: How does memory-associated place avoidance alter gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus? \u00b6 All analyses of the effect of training on hippocampal gene expression were conducted independently for each subfield. In the DG, 116 genes were upregulated in the consistently training group while 0 were upregulated in the yoked group (Fig 1.4A, Table 1.2). Among the top ten differentially expressed genes are those encoding transcription factors Egr4, Junb, SMAD. A gene ontology analysis shows an enrichment in molecular functions related to core promoter binding, nuclear localization sequence binding, signal sequence binding, poly(A) RNA binding, and heat-shock protein binding (Fig 1.4B). No genes in CA3 were differentially expressed in the consistently trained vs. yoked contrast (Table 1.2). This lack of activity is consistent with the Denny et al. study who expressed Cre-ERT2 under the direction of the activity regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) promoter regions to compare activation of neuronal populations in the hippocampus during encoding and retrieval of memory39. However, in CA1, approximately 600 genes were differentially expressed between trained vs. yoked contrasts (Fig. 1.5A, Table 1.2). The distribution of up and down-regulation of genes is symmetric in the CA1 subfield. An analysis of gene ontology categories shows an enrichment for molecular functions related to ion channel synthesis and activity (Fig. 1.5B). Fig. 1.4: Place avoidance is associated with up-regulation genes involved in regulation of transcription. A) In the dentate gyrus (DG) 116 genes are upregulated in the consistently training group compared to the yoked samples (FDR = 0.1). An analysis of enrichment in gene ontology categories shows an enrichment in molecular function processes related to promoter binding and nuclear sequence binding (p < 0.05). B) Genes and GO categories are colored according to enrichment in trained (red) or yoked (black). The active place avoidance schematics, the shaded pie-shaped region is the behaviorally relevant region for counting a number of entrances into the shock zone. Trained (red) mice are shocked in this zone, but the shocking of yoked mice is not spatially limited to the dark-grey pie-shaped zone. For code see Github . \u00b6 Research question 2: Does cognitive discrimination alter gene expression? \u00b6 Changing the shock zone location provides a test of cognitive discrimination that requires DG function36,82. Once an animal learns the new location of shock, cognitive discrimination enables judicious use knowledge of the current and former locations of shock. Yoked, consistently-trained, and conflict-trained animals vary in their degree of behaviors expressed that evidence cognitive discrimination. We asked if changes in gene expression are associated with cognitive discrimination. We found gene expression in the DG, CA3, and CA1 shows a remarkable lack of differential expression in response conflict training (Table 1.1). The results show that initial learning of the shock zone does initial learning of the shock zone does change synaptic function in the perforant path DG and in the pyramidal layer of CA1; however, less than 1/1000 of the transcriptome is differentially expressed in the animals that behaviorally demonstrated cognitive discrimination in relation. Fig. 1.5: Place avoidance is associated with increased expression of genes that regulate synaptic activity in CA1. A) In the CA1, 253 genes are upregulated in the consistently training group while only 255 are downregulated (FDR = 0.1). B) An analysis of enrichment in gene ontology (GO) categories shows an enrichment in molecular function processes related to ion channel transport and activity (p < 0.05). Genes and GO categories are colored according to enrichment in trained (red) or yoked (black). For code see Github . \u00b6 Two-way contrasts between groups DG CA3 CA1 consistent vs. yoked-consisten 116 0 508 conflict vs. consistent 0 2 0 yoked-conflict vs. yoked-consistent 1 1 409 conflict vs. yoked-conflict 4 0 0 Table 1.1: Differentially expressed genes (p < 0.1) by cognitive training and subfield. \u00b6 Consistent training alters the expression of ~100 and ~200 genes in DG and CA1, respectively. Conflict training has almost no effect on hippocampal subfield expression relative to its yoked counterpart nor to the consistently trained animals. \u00b6 Research question 3: Does unavoidable punishment (in the form of random, mild foot-shocks) alter gene expression? \u00b6 The yoked-conflict group received more foot-shocks on day two when the conflict animals were performing the cognitive discrimination task. The CA1 but not the DG or CA3 shows gene expression response to differing levels of punishment (Table 1.1). In the CA1, I identified differentially expressed of 409 genes between yoked groups that received different amounts of punishment (FDR = 0.1) (Fig. 1.6A). The volcano plots show a near symmetric distribution of genes that are higher in the consistent yoked (left side, dark-grey) and conflict yoked (right side, light grey). Analysis of enrichment in gene ontology (GO) categories shows an enrichment in molecular function processes related to glutamate receptors, signal transduction, ion channel transport in the conflict-yoked group; whereas the consistent yoked group showed an enrichment in processes related to RNA binding and ribosomal activity (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1.6B). Fig. 1.6: Additional punishment also influences gene expression in CA1. A) In the CA1, 409 genes are differentially expressed in between yoked groups that received different amounts of punishment. (FDR = 0.1). B) An analysis of enrichment in gene ontology (GO) categories shows an enrichment in molecular function processes related to ion channel transport and synaptic activity (p < 0.05). Genes and GO categories are colored according to enrichment in yoked-conflict (light grey) or yoked-consistent (dark-grey). For code see Github . \u00b6 DISCUSSION \u00b6 My approach combines hypothesis-driven and data-driven techniques to yield new insight into the dynamic nature of the hippocampus. I observed behaviors subservient of learning, memory, and cognitive discrimination in our experimental groups of mice, and we identified associated changes in the expression of specific molecular pathways in subfields hippocampus using RNA sequencing. I filled the gap by being the first to conduct an unbiased RNA sequencing screen of genes related to subfields of the hippocampus. The brain-wide scans of the Allen Institute and Cembrowski et al. were unbiased in their molecular discovery, as they examined behaviorally na\u00efve mice and so did not incorporate rigorous behavioral assays. The exquisitely detailed work of a cadre of hippocampal neuroscientists described single genes or pathways in detail, but they did not measure the activity of the entire transcriptome. This approach led to the following finding and interpretations. Gene expression in was DG most responsive to memory formation, which supports previous findings of physiological plasticity in the region Park et. 2015. One can conclude that gene expression discriminates internal versus external variables because yoked and trained mice had the identical physical experience of the world but could interpret the experience differently \u2013 gene expression in CA1 and DG sensitive to this. Different types of genes are differentially regulated in DG and CA1. Change in DG is related to nuclear signaling and expression of immediately early genes while changes in CA1 reflect membrane-level ion-channel regulation. The CA1 results also demonstrate sensitivity to the amount of unavoidable shock or stress that occurred 24h in the past. Importantly, tissue was sampled at a time when cortisol levels are very likely to be equal83,84. This CA1 response could be a molecular signature for a form of stress \u2018memory\u2019 (i..e. a persistent (24-h) change in the system as a function of experience even if the mouse does not express it by long-term behavior or physiology). Additionally, I did detect changes in protein kinases, but I did not detect any differences in the variant PKMz or PKC, even thought Pastalkova et al. 2006 and others have shown that DG synaptic plasticity and place avoidance memory is crucially mediated by PKMz85. Finally, the results demonstrated that conflict learning does not cause additional gene expression changes relative to initial learning. Perhaps the changes associated with memory formation and behavioral change occur within a network of cells that were not captured in our tissue samples. This research supports the use of transcription factors (often referred to as immediate early genes) such as Jun, Arc, c-Fos, have previously been shown to be significantly increased in hippocampal neurons in a novel environment or context86\u201388. Arc has been used to identify subpopulations of neurons that were activated during acquisition or retrieval of memory under a number of conditions39. There are several limitations to our experimental design. First of all, gene expression was only measured at one time-point. Thus I cannot say what the activity looks like during different stages of memory acquisition and recall. Secondly, I measured activity within many neurons and other cell types in a tissue sample of the hippocampal subfields. This research provided more insight into the subfield specificity of the hippocampus, but single-cell techniques will be needed to tease apart differences among cell types or cells with differencing activity states. Thirdly, I did not conduct an unbiased screen of all subfields of the hippocampus. This study overlooked the CA2, CA4, and neighboring cortical regions that send and receive information from the hippocampus. Finally, when looking for small effects, it is essential to have a sufficient sample size, so we opted to sequence more biological replicates from a few brain regions than the other way around. In the end, a small sample size does limit the power of our experiment to identify gene expression changes associated with memory. A challenge for the future will be to capture and understand molecular activity in the hippocampus before, during, and after learning. The strength of this research is its collaborative and integrative approach. We brought hypotheses and expertise from relating disciplines of biology to address current problems in neuroscience and genomics. Thus, we now have a deeper understanding of the molecular changes that are or are not associated with robust behavioral output indicative of memory. I also applied best practices in open and reproducible research to provide a robust pipeline that can be re-used. The raw and processed data, analysis pipelines, results, and interpretations are available for download, enabling the curious to export data into their environment for more specialized analyses. This dataset expands upon and complement other existing publicly available gene expression databases, mostly notably Lein et al., 2007 and Cembrowski et al., 2016.

One challenge is that memory cannot be physically isolated. Memory is an instance in which an organism's current behavior is determined by some aspect of its previous experience30. It an emergent property that researchers observe as an overt change at one or more levels of biological organization. Recent advances in molecular biology and neuroscience pushed our understanding past the concept of the neural doctrine (single neurons are the brain\u2019s information processing unit of organization) and the central dogma of molecular biology (function is coded by the process DNA->RNA->Protein) which alone do not solve the problem of understanding how the brain stores and recalls memories that change animal behavior. Neurons differ from one another in many ways: structurally, functionally and genetically, as well as the connections they make with other cells. The extent to which gene expression accounts for the function and characteristics of cell types, neural systems, and behavioral expression is unknown despite being fundamental to many research programs in biology and medicine. One goal of modern neuroscience is to fully characterize the structure and function of all the molecules in all the neurons in all the circuits of the human brain (8,9 but see 7,31). Additionally, understanding how such variability and plasticity in the brain gives rise to emergent phenotypical variation is of utmost importance for advancing neuroscience and related fields. Generations of behavioral neuroscientists have developed sophisticated paradigms for assessing the biological correlates of memory and cognition14. However, it can be a challenge to interpret the significance of observed behavior differences. \u201cThe problem with rats is that I can't ask them if they remember what they had for breakfast,\u201d Howard Eichenbaum once said32. Nevertheless, community-developed standards were established such that robust behavioral phenotypes could be used as indicators of memory-associated changes in behavior. Memory is a term used to characterize instances in which an organism's current behavior is determined by some aspect of its previous experience30. In active avoidance paradigms, the focal animal is required to emit a specific response in order to escape or avoid a noxious stimulus33. Thus, avoidance behavior is a readable outcome of memory. The hippocampus is widely known to be involved in spatial navigation, learning, and memory5. In 1909, Cajal illustrated the hippocampus with directional connections between neurons between the entorhinal cortex (EC), subregions of Cornu Ammonius' Ammon's horn (CA) and the dentate gyrus (DG), with information flowing from in the EC -> CA1 -> CA3 -> DG -> EC or through additional pathways that skip subfields or layers within subfields34. In 1971, John O'Keefe found that place cells in the hippocampus function as an internal global positions system (GPS) in our brain5,6. Different place cells are active when an animal is in different locations within the environment35. In the 2000s, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser demonstrated the place cells of the CA1 were connected to grid cells of the entorhinal cortex11. The CA1 pyramidal cells are often referred to as place cells because they activate when an animal is in a particular place in its environment. The CA3-CA1 synapse has received a lot of attention for long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and other forms of synaptic plasticity as it might relate to learning. The DG has been given some attention for adult-born neurogenesis and its role in learning and memory36\u201339. Since the early 80s with discoveries that the NMDA receptor and Calcium-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) play crucial roles in LTP, neuroscientists have been using pharmacology to identify the molecular and neural substrates of synaptic plasticity and memory. These studies linked changes in behavior to long-term potentiation, long-term depression, and the expression of numerous candidate genes40,41. Molecular and cellular biologists have shed light on what molecules serve as biomarkers for cells with different structure and function42\u201344. This tools have highlighted the heterogeneity of the structure and function of neurons and have lead to new hypothesis regarding how different neuron classes contribute to cognition. Modern genomic techniques such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing have made it possible to examine the molecular underpinnings of plasticity in animal behavior18,45\u201347. Yet despite its successes in generating discovery-driven insights, behavioral genomics has been criticized for its lack hypotheses48. Additionally, databases of gene expression for mouse hippocampi do exists49\u201353, but they provide little insight into how dynamic activity of transcriptome supports memory. The goal of this research is to marry the hypothesis-driven techniques of behavioral neuroscience with the discovery-driven methods of behavioral genomics to identify novel neuromolecular substrates of memory. First, I analyzed the behavior of mice in a task explicitly designed to test how the brain uses spatial information for memory processing. My experiment used a variant of the active place avoidance task33,36,54\u201356 which allowed us to tease apart the effects of subtle differences in an animal's experience of the environment. Then, I characterized the transcriptional pattern of activity from tissue samples from the DG-CA3-CA1 tri-synaptic pathway that has been implicated in spatial learning and memory. The results of this work showed that this work confirms previously identified sub-field specific patterns of expression and confirms previous descriptions of candidate memory gene activity in CA1. Importantly, I also detected novel patterns of transcription factor activation in the DG and a surprising lack of transcriptional plasticity in CA3. These two findings suggest new mechanisms for how information flows through a DG-CA3-CA1 pathway that has been implicated in memory. The results provide a unique perspective on the role of transcriptional stability and plasticity about hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. In the spirit of reproducible research and open science57\u201360, all data, code, and results are publically available and licensed under a creative commons for reuse for the continued advancement of basic research.","title":"INTRODUCTION"},{"location":"01_intwt15/#material-methods","text":"All animal care and use complies with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the New York University Animal Welfare Committee and the Marine Biological Laboratory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

All mice were exposed to nine sessions in the active place avoidance arena (Fig. 1.1A). Mice were placed on an elevated circular 40-cm diameter arena that rotated at 1 rpm. The arena wall was transparent and thus contained the mice to the arena while allowing it to observe the environment. The location of the mouse in the arena was determined from an overhead television camera a PC-controlled tracking system (Bio-Signal Group). Consistently trained mice in the active place avoidance task are conditioned to avoid mild shocks (constant current 0.2 mA 500 ms 60 Hz) that can be localized by visual cues in the environment. Yoked mice are delivered a sequence of unavoidable shocks that reproduces the time series of shocks received by the trained mice; however, the shocks delivered to the mice cannot be localized by visual cues in the environment. All sessions in the arena last 10 minutes. Mice are allowed to become familiar with walking on a rotating arena during a 10 min pretraining session. Then mice undergo 3, 10-min avoidance training sessions separated by a 2 h inter-trial interval. Mice are returned to their home cage overnight. The next day, mice are subjected to a 10-min \u2018Retest session\u2019 where the shock is in the same location as before.

I observed behaviors subservient of learning, memory, and cognitive discrimination in our experimental groups of mice, and we identified associated changes in the expression of specific molecular pathways in subfields hippocampus using RNA sequencing. I filled the gap by being the first to conduct an unbiased RNA sequencing screen of genes related to subfields of the hippocampus. The brain-wide scans of the Allen Institute and Cembrowski et al. were unbiased in their molecular discovery, as they examined behaviorally na\u00efve mice and so did not incorporate rigorous behavioral assays. The exquisitely detailed work of a cadre of hippocampal neuroscientists described single genes or pathways in detail, but they did not measure the activity of the entire transcriptome. This approach led to the following finding and interpretations. Gene expression in was DG most responsive to memory formation, which supports previous findings of physiological plasticity in the region Park et. 2015. One can conclude that gene expression discriminates internal versus external variables because yoked and trained mice had the identical physical experience of the world but could interpret the experience differently \u2013 gene expression in CA1 and DG sensitive to this. Different types of genes are differentially regulated in DG and CA1. Change in DG is related to nuclear signaling and expression of immediately early genes while changes in CA1 reflect membrane-level ion-channel regulation. The CA1 results also demonstrate sensitivity to the amount of unavoidable shock or stress that occurred 24h in the past. Importantly, tissue was sampled at a time when cortisol levels are very likely to be equal83,84. This CA1 response could be a molecular signature for a form of stress \u2018memory\u2019 (i..e. a persistent (24-h) change in the system as a function of experience even if the mouse does not express it by long-term behavior or physiology). Additionally, I did detect changes in protein kinases, but I did not detect any differences in the variant PKMz or PKC, even thought Pastalkova et al. 2006 and others have shown that DG synaptic plasticity and place avoidance memory is crucially mediated by PKMz85. Finally, the results demonstrated that conflict learning does not cause additional gene expression changes relative to initial learning. Perhaps the changes associated with memory formation and behavioral change occur within a network of cells that were not captured in our tissue samples. This research supports the use of transcription factors (often referred to as immediate early genes) such as Jun, Arc, c-Fos, have previously been shown to be significantly increased in hippocampal neurons in a novel environment or context86\u201388. Arc has been used to identify subpopulations of neurons that were activated during acquisition or retrieval of memory under a number of conditions39. There are several limitations to our experimental design. First of all, gene expression was only measured at one time-point. Thus I cannot say what the activity looks like during different stages of memory acquisition and recall. Secondly, I measured activity within many neurons and other cell types in a tissue sample of the hippocampal subfields. This research provided more insight into the subfield specificity of the hippocampus, but single-cell techniques will be needed to tease apart differences among cell types or cells with differencing activity states. Thirdly, I did not conduct an unbiased screen of all subfields of the hippocampus. This study overlooked the CA2, CA4, and neighboring cortical regions that send and receive information from the hippocampus. Finally, when looking for small effects, it is essential to have a sufficient sample size, so we opted to sequence more biological replicates from a few brain regions than the other way around. In the end, a small sample size does limit the power of our experiment to identify gene expression changes associated with memory. A challenge for the future will be to capture and understand molecular activity in the hippocampus before, during, and after learning. The strength of this research is its collaborative and integrative approach. We brought hypotheses and expertise from relating disciplines of biology to address current problems in neuroscience and genomics. Thus, we now have a deeper understanding of the molecular changes that are or are not associated with robust behavioral output indicative of memory.

The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which encodes fragile x mental retardation protein (FMRP), a protein that regulates the local translation of a subset of mRNAs at synapses. In the absence of FMRP, dysregulated mRNA translation can lead to altered synaptic function, loss of protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity, and impaired cognitive discrimination. To better understand the effects of silencing the FMR1 gene, I analyzed learning behavior and hippocampal gene expression. I confirmed that genetic knock out of FMR1 (FMR1-KO) alters the expression of avoidance behavior in a way that indicates that FMR1-KO mice do not use hippocampal place memory to avoid the shock zone. Contrary to previously published results, initial learning was not very robust during this experiment, possibly due to working in a \u201cnoisy\u201d environment where environmental distractions made learning difficult. I identified 20 genes whose expression in the CA1 hippocampal subfield was altered by constitutive knockout of FMR1. Using a meta-analysis with published data, I found a consistent and reproducible pattern of downregulation of expression Efcab and Sperpina3n and altered calcium signaling in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. These results suggest that despite the proximal effects of FMR1 knockout being on translation dysregulation, loss of FMRP also leads to transcriptional dysregulation, involving multiple genes that contribute to autism spectrum disorder. Additional research is needed to understand how the loss of FMR1 activity affects hippocampal-dependent memory use. INTRODUCTION \u00b6 Fragile X syndrome is the most prevalent form of genetically inherited intellectual disability89. This X-linked disorder is caused by mutations in the untranslated region of the FMR1 gene resulting in a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion higher than 200 that gives rise to hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing90. Thus, patients with fragile X syndrome do not make the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Autistic-like features and problems with working and short-term memory are frequent in patients with fragile X syndrome91. Impaired memory discrimination is thought to lead to exaggerated responses to environmental changes in autistic patients. Autism spectrum disorder is a genetically heterogeneous condition. While many genes predisposing an individual with autism spectrum disorder have been identified, an understanding of the causal disease mechanism remains elusive92. A deeper understanding of the molecular interaction between fmr1 in a brain region-specific manner might shed light on phenotypic variation. FMRP regulates the local translation of a subset of about 400 mRNAs at synapses93. In the absence of FMRP, dysregulated mRNA translation leads to altered synaptic function and loss of protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity89. Voineagu et al. 2011 found that striking regional patterns of attenuated gene expression in the frontal and temporal cortex, suggesting abnormalities in cortical patterning94. FMR1-KO mice95 show that cognitive discrimination deficits are prominent, but learning and memory themselves appear unimpaired55. Cognitive discrimination requires distinguishing between similar but distinct experiences. To better understand the effects of silencing the FMR1 gene, I analyzed hippocampal gene expression and cognitive behavior including learning memory and cognitive discrimination. I investigated cognitive discrimination by changing the location of a mild shock, requiring the subjects to distinguish between the current and prior locations of shock. I hypothesized that FMR1-KO would alter cognitive discrimination performance and the activity of hundreds of genes in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. To evaluate these predictions, I used an active place avoidance task to measure the behavioral correlates of learning, memory, and cognitive discrimination. Then, I analyzed ex vivo hippocampus electrophysiological data to estimate changes in CA3-CA1 synaptic strength. Next, I identified patterns of differential gene expression in the CA1 subfield as a result of constitutive FMR1 knockout. Finally, I reproduced the finding of a recently published96 study of gene expression in the FMR1-KO hippocampus, and I compared my reproduction of the Ceolin study to my own finding to identify robust patterns of FMR1 dependent gene expression in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. This approach provides a blueprint for investigation of the behavior, physiology, and molecular consequences of FMRP loss in a rodent model. The data, analysis tools, and results are publically available for readers to investigate independently97. METHODS \u00b6 All animal care and use procedures comply with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the New York University Animal Welfare Committee and the Marine Biological Laboratory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male C57BL/6J wild-type and Fragile X mental retardation protein knockout mice (FMR1-KO) were housed on a 12:12 (light: dark) cycle with continuous access to food and water in home cages with up to five littermates. Active Place Avoidance \u00b6 I used the active place avoidance task with conflict learning to observe initial avoidance learning and cognitive discrimination in WT and FMR1-KO mice54,61,36. The behavioral paradigm was explicitly designed to constrain animal behavior to provide hypothesis-driven insight into the role of FMRP in cognition. In this task, yoked mice and trained mice experience the same physical world, but they have a different internal representation of the world as expressed by their spatial use of the active place avoidance arena. The use of consistent and conflict training allows the experimenter to tease apart initial avoidance learning and cognitive discrimination. All mice were exposed to nine sessions in the active place avoidance arena (Fig. 2.1). Mice were placed on an elevated circular (40 cm diameter) arena that rotated at 1 rpm. The arena wall was transparent and thus contained the mice to the arena while allowing them to observe the environment. The location of the mouse in the arena was determined by a PC-controlled video tracking system (Bio-Signal Group Corp.) using an overhead video camera. Consistently trained mice in the active place avoidance task are conditioned to avoid mild shocks (constant current 0.2 mA, 60 Hz, 500 ms) that can be localized by visual cues in the environment. Yoked mice are delivered a sequence of unavoidable shocks that reproduces the time series of shocks received by the trained mice; however, the shocks delivered to the mice cannot be localized to any consistent places in the environment. All sessions in the arena last 10 minutes. Mice were allowed to become familiar with walking on the rotating arena during a 10 min \u2018Pre-training session'. Then mice undergo three, 10-min avoidance-training sessions separated by a two h inter-trial interval. Mice are returned to their home cage overnight. The next day, mice are subjected to a 10-min \u2018Retest session\u2019 where the shock is in the same location as before. For the next three training sessions, the shock zone remains in the same place for consistently trained animals, but it is rotated 180\u00b0 for the conflict-trained mice. The next day, all mice are subjected to a 1-min \u201cRetention session\u201d with the shock off. Littermates were randomly assigned to one of our treatment groups (Fig 2.1). Fig. 2.1: Active place avoidance task with conflict training. \u00b6 Mice were assigned to one of four groups: consistently-trained (red), yoked-consistent (dark grey), conflict-trained (peach), or yoked-conflict (light grey). Mice were placed on the rotating arena (1 rpm) for training sessions that lasted 10 min and was separated by 2-h intersession interval or overnight (~17 h). The physical conditions are identical for all mice during pre-training and retention. Sample sizes for each treatment group and genotype are shown on the bottom right. \u00b6 Statistical analyses of behavior and synaptic physiology \u00b6 Place avoidance was evaluated by end-point measures output by TrackAnalysis software (Bio-Signal Group Corp., Acton, MA). Forty quantitative variables were measured that capture the animals' use of space and time. I evaluated the reduction in entrances into the shock zone to estimate place avoidance. A three-way ANOVA with subsequent Tukey Honest Significant Differences (Tukey HSD) tests were carried out to determine influences of Genotype * Treatment Group * Training Session and the Genotype * Treatment Group interaction on the number of entrances. A Tukey Honest Significant Differences (Tukey HSD) test was carried out to determine the component influence of Treatment Groups. A two-way ANOVA was carried out to determine the influence of Genotype * Treatment Group and their interaction on CA3-CA1 synaptic strength, as measured by the maximum field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) slope. Tissue preparation and electrophysiology \u00b6 Thirty minutes after the last cognitive training session, mice were anesthetized with 2% (vol/vol) isoflurane for 2 minutes and decapitated. Transverse 300 \u03bcm brain slices were cut using a vibratome (model VT1000 S, Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) and incubated at 36\u00b0C for 30 min and then at room temperature for 90 min in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4 and 25 Glucose)64,65. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) from the CA3-CA1 input (Stratum Radiatum) were obtained in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation with bipolar electrodes. Stimulus-response relationships between input voltage stimulation and fEPSP slope were generated at increasing voltage stimulations at Stratum Radiatum65. RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics \u00b6 The CA1 subfields were microdissected using a 0.25 mm punch (Electron Microscopy Systems) and a Zeiss dissecting scope. RNA was isolated using the Maxwell 16 LEV RNA Isolation Kit (a donation from Promega, Madison, WI). RNA libraries were prepared by the Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Facility at the University of Texas at Austin and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Raw reads were transferred from the GSAF to the Stampede Cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Facility (TACC) via Amazon Cloud. Quality of the data was checked using the program FASTQC66 and visualized using MultiQC67 (Fig. A3). Low-quality reads and contaminating adapter sequences were removed using the program Cutadapt70. I used Kallisto68 for pseudo-alignment of reads and transcript counting using the-the Gencode M11 mouse transcriptome69. Statistics and data visualization of RNA-sequencing data \u00b6 Transcript counts from Kallisto were imported into R62 and aggregated to yield gene counts using the \u2018gene\u2019 identifier from the Gencode transcriptome. I used DESeq271 to normalize and quantify gene counts with a false discovery corrected (FDR) p-value < 0.1. The DESeq2 model included only genotype (WT vs. FMR1-KO) since all samples came from the CA1 subfield of the yoked-consistent treatment group. Hierarchical clustering by correlation was used to visualize the patterns of differential gene expression71\u201376. I used ggplot276, cowplot75, pheatmap78, viridis79, and colorblindr80 to visualize the results. Multi-panel figures were created using Adobe Illustrator. Archival of data, code, and figures \u00b6 I archived the raw sequence data and intermediate data files in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus Database (accession GSE100225). The data, code, and results are publically available on GitHub , with a stable archived at Zenodo 97. I also used publically available dataset (accession GSE94559) of gene counts from the Ceolin et al. 201796 study on CA1 pyramidal neuron gene expression in FMR1-KO mice. RESULTS \u00b6 The goal of this research was to identify transcriptional changes in FMR1-KO mice that might explain impaired memory discrimination. I used the active place avoidance task with conflict learning to observe initial avoidance learning and cognitive discrimination in WT and FMR1-KO mice. Given that FMRP is a translational modifier, little research has been done to investigate transcriptional changes upstream that might occur through regulatory feedback processes. In the Active Place Avoidance Task, place learning and memory are observed by examining multiple aspects of behavior (see Chapter 1). I focused on the proportion of time spent in different quadrants of the arena, the number of entrances into the shock zone, and path to the first entrance. Supplementary Figure: Hypotheses and predictions \u00b6 No significant pre-training group differences \u00b6 First, I examined the data to determine whether the groups were different before experiencing shock. I found that all groups where equal in the proportion of time spent in four quadrants of the arena (Fig. 2.2A). There was no significant effect of genotype or treatment group on pre-training proportion of time spent in the shock zone (mean = 0.24; genotype: F(1,38) = 0.438, p = 0.512; group: F(3,38) = 0.438, p = 0.512), clockwise (mean = 0.26; genotype: F(1,38) = 0.153, p = 0.698; group: F(3,38) = 0.507, p = 0.680), opposite (mean = 0.21,; genotype: F(1,38) = 0.008, p = 0.929; group: F(3,38) = 1.051, p = 0.381), or counter clockwise (mean = 0.28, ; genotype: F(1,38) = 0.012, p = 0.913; group: F(3,38) = 0.979, p = 0.413). There was also no significant effect of genotype, training, or the interaction on pre-training number of entrances (Fig. 2.2B) or path to the first entrance (Figure 2.2C), which are the two measures that will be used shortly to evaluate the avoidance strategy that mice are using. There was no significant effect of genotype or training on the number of entrances (mean = 28.58, genotype: F(1,35) = 0.106, p = 0.747; training: F(3,35)= 1.717, p = 0.181) or path to the 1st entrance (mean = 0.42, genotype: F(1,35) = 0.165, p = 0.92; training: F(3,35)= 1.583, p = 0.211). Fig. 2.2: No group differences before behavioral manipulation. \u00b6 A) All treatment groups spend ~ 25% of their time equally across four quadrants of the arena during the pre-training session (pink: future shock zone, dark green: clockwise, green: opposite the shock zone, light green: counterclockwise). B) Pre-training number of entrances into the shock zone and C) path to the first entrance are not significantly different between treatment groups and genotypes (dark grey: yoked-consistent, red: consistently-trained, light grey: yoked-conflict, peach: conflict-trained). \u00b6 Training has more substantial effect than genotype on avoidance behaviors After confirming that the proportion of time spent in each quadrant was roughly 0.25 for each group during pre-training, I asked if there were group differences in the distribution of time spent during the training, retest, and/or conflict sessions (Fig. 2.3). Using a linear model, I found that time spent in the shock zone is not significantly influenced by genotype (F(1,286) = 1.49, p = 0.22), but time spent in the shock zone is influenced by training (F(2,286) = 128.58, p < 0.001). This linear model with training, genotype, and the interaction explains 73% of the variation in time spent in the shock zone. As expected, among only the yoked groups, there is no effect of genotype or training on time spent in the area that corresponds to the shock zone in the trained groups (genotype: F(1,80) = 0.040, p = 0.84, training: (F(1,80) = 3.438, p = 0.067)). Fig. 2.3: The proportion of time spent in in the arena with the shock on. \u00b6 The average proportion of time spent in each 60 degree quadrant of the arena was calculated or each group for each session with the shock was on (T1, T2, T3: training sessions 1-3; R1: retest; C1, C2, C3: conflict training sessions; pink: future shock zone; dark green: clockwise; green: opposite the shock zone; light green: counter clockwise). For trained mice, mice are expected to spend very little time in the shock zone (<0.4%) and to equally split their time between the three remaining quadrants (~32% each). For yoked mice, time spent is expected to be evenly distributed across quadrants (~25% each). \u00b6 The differences between the conflict and consistently trained mice are apparent during the three conflict training sessions (Fig 2.4). Both consistent and conflict groups avoid the shock zone, spending less than 2% of their time in the shock zone, but there is no difference between groups (mean = 0.019, F(1,78) = 1.2166, p = 0.27). Consistently trained groups spend significantly less time clockwise of the shock zone than conflict trained groups (F(1,78) = 23.3405, p < 0.001). Consistently trained groups spend more time in the counterclockwise zone than conflict trained mice (F (1,78) = 8.2837, p = 0.005). Fig. 2.4: Consistent and conflict trained mice use space differently during conflict training sessions. \u00b6 A) During the conflict training sessions, consistent and conflict mice both avoid the shock zone, but there is not a difference between groups. B) Consistently trained mice spend significantly less time in space clockwise to the shock zone as indicated by the A and B in small font above the corresponding group. C) All groups spend more time on average in the space opposite the shock zone, but there are no group differences. D) Consistently trained mice spend more time in the counterclockwise zone than conflict mice as indicated by the A and B in small font above the corresponding group. Legend) dark grey: yoked-consistent, red: consistently-trained, light grey: yoked-conflict, peach: conflict-trained. \u00b6 Initial place learning is not as strong as predicted in WT mice \u00b6 After establishing place avoidance behavior in the trained groups, I next investigated the extent to which shock (or punishment) and memory contributed to place avoidance by analyzing the number of entrances to the shock zone and the path to 1st entrance (Fig. 2.5). I unexpectedly found evidence that mice were not using memory by analysis of path to the first entrance, but instead they were relying on a non-spatial strategy to avoid the shock zone that was dependent on the shock punishment, which was assessed by the number of entrances into the shocked zone by the trained groups. This was unexpected given the results of Chapter 1 where using these measures of behavior, I observed a strong signature of learning and place avoidance. There was no effect of genotype on the number of entrances into the shock zone at any given time point (Fig. 2.5B, C). However, there was an effect of genotype on the path to first entrance during the retest, but this appears to be driven by unexplained avoidance behavior in a yoked group (Fig. 2.5 E, F). At this level of analysis, the evidence for place learning is weak, certainly not as robust in WT or FMR1-KO mice. Fig. 2.5: Summary of punishment and estimates of memory in WT and FMR1-KO mice. A) Expected results for number of entrances based on data from Chapter 1 and Radwan et al.55 B,C) Consistent and conflict trained mice from WT and FMR1-KO groups to make fewer entrances into the shock zone than yoked-mice; however, the pattern does not exactly match the expected results. D) Expected results for number of entrances based on data from Chapter 1 and Radwan et al.55 E, F) Consistent and conflict trained mice from WT FMR1-KO do not show evidence of place memory until after the first day of initial training. This pattern does also not mirror the expected results. Legend) Pre: pre-training; T1, T2, T3: training sessions 1-3; C1, C2, C3: conflict training sessions; Reten: retention session; dark grey: yoked-consistent, red: consistently-trained, light grey: yoked-conflict, peach: conflict-trained. The pie-shaped shaded regions of the inserts highlight the region used to count the number of entrances. \u00b6 FMR1-KO do not show evidence of using place memory for solving the task \u00b6 The conflict training session in the Active Place Avoidance Task allows us to test two hypotheses. The first, fundamental hypothesis is that the mice are using a strategy that utilizes place memory to avoid shock. If, and only if, they are using place memory, then the conflict task allows us to assess how well they discriminate between memory for the initial location of shock and the current relocated position of shock (Fig. A4). The rationale is as follows: If the mice are using place memory to avoid the initial location of shock, then they will have learned the specific location of shock. By avoiding the location itself, they avoid shock without experiencing it. The behavior would be characterized by avoidance of the shock location rather than escape of shock itself. Alternatively, the mice could be avoiding shock by escaping after receiving shock rather than by using memory of the location to avoid it. Here their behavior would be characterized by escape but not by avoidance. I distinguish between these two possibilities by measuring the number of entrances, the length of the path to first entrance, and the probability of being in the shock zone? If the mice are using place memory, then moving the shock zone to another place should make their memory no longer adaptive and their ability to avoid shock should be disturbed. Alternatively, if they were merely escaping shock without regard for exactly where it is, then they should not be disturbed by changing the shock zone at all as their strategy of effectively responding to shock should be equally effective after the shock was relocated to the opposite part of the environment, as in the conflict sessions (Fig. A4). There was a clear difference in the number of entrances by WT consistent and WT conflict trained groups, indicating first that the WT mice used place memory to avoid shock during the initial training trials. Because the number of entrances decreased during conflict training, this indicates that WT mice used cognitive discrimination to distinguish between their memory for the initial location of shock and their memory for the current location of shock (Fig 2.5B, 2.6A, 2.6B. In contrast, the FMR1-KO consistent and the FMR1-KO conflict groups did not differ after the shock location was relocated for the conflict group, and the FMR1-KO conflict group did not change their measures of place avoidance after the shock was relocated. The inability to observe these difference, provide clear evidence that FMR1-KO consistent mice do not use place memory to avoid shock in our conditions, and thus their cognitive discrimination abilities cannot be assessed (Fig 2.5C, Fig 2.6 A, B). Whereas, the WT mice demonstrate clear evidence of place learning and cognitive discrimination. Fig. 2.6: FMR1-KO mice avoid the shock zone using a non-place memory strategy. A, B) WT but not FMR1-KO consistent mice make fewer entrances into the shock zone than conflict mice on C1. C, D) Path to first entrance on C2 is no different between groups indicating a lack of evidence for the use of place memory. Groups are shown in dark grey: yoked-consistent, red: consistently-trained, light grey: yoked-conflict, peach: conflict-trained, dashed lines: FMR1-KO, solid lines: WT. \u00b6 For this statistical analysis, I analyzed the three conflict sessions (T4/C1, T5/C2, and T6/C3) using a three-way ANOVA with Tukey Honest Significant Differences (Tukey HSD) test to determine the influence of Genotype * Treatment Group * Training Session and the interaction on the number of entrances during the active place avoidance task with the conflict training. As expected Treatment Group had a highly significant effect on number of entrances [F(1, 69)= 41.3, p < 0.001]. The interaction between the effects of Genotype and Training Group was not significant [F(1, 69)= 0.009, p = 0.924]. While there is a significant effect of genotype alone on the number of entrances [F(1, 69)= 8.17, p = 0.005], there was not a significant difference between WT conflict and FMR1-KO conflict (p = 0.78) or between WT yoked-conflict and FMR1-KO yoked-conflict (p = 0.93). Subtle differences in avoidance behavior during retention \u00b6 Finally, I asked if the genotypes differed during the retention test when the shock is off which allows assessment of memory retention. Since the shock is off, the animals will not exhibit any escape behavior. Thus, avoidance of the shock zone can be attributed to place memory. I found that trained mice continue to spend less time in the former shock zone quadrant than yoked mice, but their path to the shock zone is not significantly longer indicating a place response driven by memory in the trained groups compared to the yoked group before the possibility of extinction learning (Fig. 2.7). Extinction learning is logically only assessed after the mice experience there is no shock in the place they had expected it. The time spent in the shock zone during the retention session assesses both the strength of the place memory and extinction of the condition avoidance behavior. It was affected by the training group (F(3,42) = 5.5420, p = 0.00269) but not by genotype (F(1,42) = 0.043, p = 0.837), and this effect is driven by the difference between the consistent and yoked-consistent (p = 0.00684) but not between conflict and yoked-conflict groups (p = 0.125)(Fig. 2.7A). It is possible that this variation in the yoked animals obscures our examination of the memory in the trained animals. Fig. 2.7: During recall, mice avoid the shock zone. A) Trained mice spend less time in the shock zone than their yoked counterparts. B) They also make fewer entrances into the shock zone, C) but their path to the shock zone is not significantly longer. Legend) dark grey: yoked-consistent, red: consistently-trained, light grey: yoked-conflict, peach: conflict-trained, pink: future shock zone, dark green: clockwise, green: opposite the shock zone, light green: counterclockwise. \u00b6 Consistently trained mice also make fewer entrances into the shock zone compared to mice in the yoked group in both WT and FMR1-KO groups (Fig. 2.7B), but their path to the shock zone is not significantly longer (Fig. 2.7C) which provides conflicting evidence about whether or not the mice are using place memory. The conflict trained FMR1-KO mice do not make a significantly fewer number of entrances into the shock zone, which provides more evidence that they do not have a place memory. The results of a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD was are visualized on Figure 2.C. Consistent with the evidence for poor place memory, I found no change in synaptic strength at the CA3-CA1 synapse (as measured by maximum fEPSP slope) due to genotype or training (Fig. 2.8). Genotype alone was not significant [F(1, 48)= 0.133, p = 0.738], and interaction between Genotype and Training Group was not significant [F(3, 48)= 0.304, p = 0.822]. Thus, even though Calmodulin activity is reduced, synaptic strength is not diminished. Fig. 2.8: CA3-CA1 synaptic strength is not altered by genotype or place avoidance training. The maximum fEPSP slope is no difference between groups indicating that neither training or genotype influence synaptic strength at CA3-CA1 synapses. WT: filled violin plot, FMR1-KO, open violin plots, dark grey: yoked-consistent, red: consistently-trained, light grey: yoked-conflict, peach. \u00b6 CA1 transcriptional response to constitutive FMR1 knockout \u00b6 Given the lack a strong and robust signal of hippocampus-dependent place learning, I elected not to continue looking for the molecular underpinnings of impaired cognitive functions in the FMR1-KO mouse. Instead, I decided to investigate whether there are molecular differences between the WT and FMR1-KO mice when the internal representations of the world are equivalent, as far as I can tell from behavior. Thus, I sequenced the transcriptome the CA1 subfield of the dorsal hippocampus from the mice in the yoked-consistent treatment group (Fig. 2.9A). Fig. 2.9: FMR1-KO show downregulation of calcium ion signaling in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. A) The sample size for RNA-sequencing is 8 WT and 8 FMR1-KO tissues from the CA1 subfield from only the consistent-yoke group. B) Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes shows that only 13 genes are upregulated in response to FMR1KO while 16, including FMR1, were downregulated in the CA1 subfield of yoked-consistent mice. C) Down-regulation of ion channel binding, receptor binding, calcium binding, metal ion membrane transport, calcium ion transmembrane transporter, delayed rectifier potassium channel, channel, cation channel, channel regulator, calmodulin binding, PDZ domain binding, structural molecular, and structural constituent of ribosome. On the plot, different fonts are used to indicate significance (bold: p < 0.01, regular: p < 0.05) and color indicates enrichment with either up (red) or down (blue) regulated genes. The fraction next to GO category name indicates the fraction of \"good\" genes that exceed the p-value cutoff. \u00b6 RNA was isolated from a tissue sample (250 \u03bcm in diameter x 300 \u03bcm thickness) from the CA1 subfield of the dorsal hippocampus. Transcriptomes were constructed from mRNA-enriched Illumina libraries; transcript levels were estimated with Kalliso18 using the Gencode Mouse reference transcirptome19, statistical significance genes and molecular functions were inferred using DESeq221 and GO_MWU30, respectively. I identified 20 genes whose expression in the CA1 subfield was altered by the constitutive elimination of FMRP (Fig 2.9B). About half of these genes are upregulated in FMR1-KO mice (Apc2, Arel1, Brf1, Cry, Fibcd1, Grin1, Ncdn, Pnmal2, Prpf8, Sidt1, Slc8a2, Tnik, and Wipf3) while the other half are down-regulated (Cacna1g, Car4, Ccnd1, Cpne7, Dlx1, Efcab6, Fgfr1, FMR1, Kcnt1, Mtus1, Plat, Serpina3n, Slc29a4, Sstr3, and Xbp1) (Fig 2.9B). Next, I used an analysis of gene ontology to identify pattern of enrichment or depletion of molecular activity. In response to FMR1-KO, I found a depletion of activity related to ion channel binding, receptor binding, calcium binding, metal ion membrane transport, calcium ion transmembrane transporter, delayed rectifier potassium channel, channel, cation channel, channel regulator, calmodulin binding, PDZ domain binding, structural molecular, and structural constituent of ribosome. The results suggest an overall disruption of calcium signaling (Fig 2.9C). Reproduction of and comparison to the Ceolin et al. 2017 study \u00b6 Next, I reanalyzed public data in order to reproduce the results from the study by Ceolin et al. 2017, which used fluorescence labeling to selectively identify and sequence pyramidal neurons in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus from WT and FMR1-KO mice (Fig 2.10A). My reanalysis of their data produced a very similar pattern of gene expression and list of differentially expressed genes with roughly equal up and downregulation of expression. Then, I asked how many of their differentially expressed genes are differentially expressed in my study. I found that downregulation of expression of Efcab6 and Serpina3n was consistent in both the Ceolin data and in my data (Fig 2.10C). Fig. 2.10: Reanalysis of the Ceolin et al. (2017) data for direct comparison of results. A) Graphical representation of the samples for the Ceolin et al. (2017) study examining CA1 expression in WT and FMR1-KO mice. Ceolin and colleagues use immunohistochemistry to stain for FMRP (pink) or hemagglutinin (cyan) in the CA1 subfield. B) Analysis showing that 39 of top 45 most significant (p < 0.01) genes in my reproduction of the analysis, make up over half of the top most significant (p < 0.05) genes of from the Ceolin study. However, only 2 genes from the reproduction of the Ceolin study were also found to be differentially anlaysis in my analysis (described in Fig 2.9). C) Reproduction: This volcano plot shows that my analysis of the Ceolin et al count data identified 88 genes that are up-regulated in FMR1-KO mice and the 146 genes that are up-regulated in WT mice a p < 0.05. Comparison: The gene expression and significance values from the Ceolin data are color-coded by the levels of significance from my results described in Fig 2.9. In other words, the results from Fig 2.9 are projected on top of the results from the Ceolin study. Four genes that are upregulated in WT in my study were also upregulated in my reproduction of the Ceolin data.D) Hierarchical clustering shows the names and expression patterns of those same significant genes. D) Gene Ontology analysis showing a very similar pattern of depletion of calcium channel activity as was shown in Fig. 2.8). In contrast, Ceolin detected enrichment of ribosomal processes in response to FMR1-KO in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Legend) Teal: Enriched in FMR1-KO, pink: enriched in WT, grey: genes with insignificant expression, black: genes whose expression was not calculated in my original analysis \u00b6 Next, I asked whether the genes that I calculated to be significantly different were also identified by Ceolin as significantly different. I determined that 39 of top 45 most significant (p < 0.01) genes in my analysis make up over half of the most significant (p < 0.05) genes of from the Ceolin study (Fig 2.10B). Of my list of \"replicated\" 39 differentially expressed genes, two genes (Serpina3a and Efcab6) were also identified in my analysis of differential expression (Fig. 2.10D). My GO analysis highlighted different but also overlapping patterns. The Ceolin study highlights the molecular function enriched pathways in FMR1-KO mice, whereas my analysis provided stronger evidence for a suppression of calcium receptor-related functions (Fig 2.10E). DISCUSSION \u00b6 This research utilized an active place avoidance task in combined a genetic manipulation of the fragile X metal retardation protein-encoding gene (FMR1) to study the neural and molecular mechanisms that underlie hippocampal-dependent avoidance learning and spatial memory. Confirmed no systematic pre-training group differences \u00b6 I first confirmed that there were no systematic difference in space use (as indicated by the proportion of time spent in each quadrant) before the onset of training (Fig. 2.2A). There were also no differences in the average length of the path to the first entrance or the number of entrances into the (future, initial) shock zone (Fig 2.2B, C). This is an important baseline to establishing before examining the expression of avoidance behavior and spatial memory use. Confirmed the expression of avoidance behavior in avoidance trained groups \u00b6 Next, I demonstrated that both consistent and conflict trained mice from the WT and FMR1-KO groups can avoid the rotating shock zone in all trials where the shock is on. The results demonstrate that both consistent and conflict trained groups from WT and FMR1-KO genotypes spending less than 2% of their time in the shock zone whereas yoked mice spend an equal amount of time (25%) in all four quadrants of the arena (Fig 2.3). Determined that initial place learning was weaker than predicted in wild-type mice \u00b6 Next, I examined whether or not the genotypes differed in initial learning of the shock zone. The prediction based on published literature is that both genotypes learn the task equally well (see Radwan55, Chapter 181, or Fig 2.4A, D). On training sessions 1-3, differences in the path to the first entrance between yoked and trained are minimal indicating little evidence of acquiring place memory during the initial training session (Fig 2.4 E). Additionally, the mean number of entrances into the shock zone by the WT trained groups is higher than predicted based on previous research, indicating that the animals need more reinforcement to learn the location of the shock zone (Fig 2.4 B). On Day 2, however, the WT mice showed evidence for using place memory to solve the task (Fig 2.4 E). Therefore, I concluded that initial learning of was weak but that WT mice to indeed use a hippocampal-dependent place avoidance strategy to solve the task. WT and FMR1 mice use different strategies to solve the place avoidance task \u00b6 However, weak the performance of trained WT mice on Day 1, the conflict task on Day 2 highlights the fact that the mice are indeed using place memory to avoid the shock zone. The wild-type conflict mice made four times as many entrances into the shock zone on the first conflict trial compared to the wild-type mice. Both consistent and conflict WT groups perform equally well by the third conflict session on Day 2 (Fig. 2.6A, 2.6B). Together, these data suggest that wild-type mice use a hippocampal-dependent place avoidance strategy to solve the task. Thus, wild-type mice that are conflict-trained show evidence of memory discrimination by using spatial orientation to avoid the shock zone on Day 1 and Day 2 when the environment shifts. On the other hand, FMR1-KO mice performed the task well on Day1 as evidenced by the trained mice displaying fewer entrances into the shock zone during initial training (Fig. 2.5C). However, FMR1-KO animals appear to never use place memory as a strategy for solving this task of avoiding the shock zone during any of the training sessions with the shock on (Fig. 2.5F). Additionally, the conflict-trained animals do not show evidence of discriminating between the first and the second location of the shock zone. Conflict trained FMR1-KO mice do not perform more poorly on the task than consistently trained FMR1-KO mice (Fig. 2.6A, 2.6B) indicating that they do not have to discriminate between place memories of the old and new shock zone. The weak learning demonstrated by the WT mice may or may not have been due to extraneous factors in the room that suppressed initial learning. Whatever the cause, it gave the FMR1-KO mice the opportunity to demonstrate a non-hippocampal dependent place avoidance strategy that was a successful way to solve the task. To continue exploring the effects of FMR1 loss of function, it will be essential to study brain function in multiple learning contexts with different environments. Neural-transcriptomics \u00b6 Given the lack of robust place learning, I opted to focus solely on the effect of genotype for the RNA-sequencing analysis. Thus, I selected naive animals (yoked-conflict mice without cognitive training) for subsequent analysis of the transcriptional effects of gene-knockout better. Overall, I found that very few genes appear to be affected in their expression by FMR1-KO. I found that only 20 genes in the CA1 hippocampal subfield differed significantly between yoked-consistent WT and yoked-consistent FMR1-KO mice (Fig 2.8B). Among the affected genes were those that genes with mRNA or protein products known to interact with FMRP directly or are known risk genes for autism spectrum disorder. Detect\u00ac\u00acion of minimal FMR1 transcripts was expected given the method of gene knockout95. The protein encoded by Ccnd2 is a highly conserved cyclin that regulates cyclin-dependent kinases. Co-localization of FMRP and Ccnd2 mRNA has been shown in the developing brain98, and it was downregulated in another FMR1-KO study96. Another down-regulated gene is Serpina3, a putative biomarker for Alzheimer\u2019s disease has also been shown to be down-regulated in FMR1-KO mice96,99. The Ceolin et al. (2017) study (both the published dataset and my reproduction) identified down-regulation of, Serpina3n, as being strongly down-regulated in FMR1-KO mice (Fig 2.10). Serpina3 is not the only gene shared by neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Fragile X syndrome. mGluR dysfunction has also linked to both100 Interestingly, the gene encoding the ionotropic glutamate Receptor (Grin1) was upregulated in WT mice. Using immuno-precipitation (IP) followed by microarray analysis of gene expression Brown et al. 2001 found that the association of Grin1a mRNA and the FMRP-bound large messenger-ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex was enriched in WT-IP compared with the FMR1-KO-IP93. Glutamate receptors are known to influence long-term synaptic modulation by stimulating the synthesis of synaptic proteins, including postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) and FMRP101\u2013104. The expression of genes involved in calcium ion binding appear to be downregulated in FMR1-KO mice. The gene encoding the pore-forming \u03b11 subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel (Cacna1g) is also among the list of down-regulated genes in my study. SNPs in Cacna1g and other calcium channel genes have been found to be associated with autism spectrum disorder105\u2013107. The gene Efcab6 (EF-Hand Calcium Binding Domain 6) encode a protein that is involved with calcium ion binding and transcriptional regulation. Calcium binding and calcium transport are also notably on the list of molecular functions that are significantly downregulated in FMR1-KO mice in both this study (Fig 2.8C) and my reproduction of the Ceolin study (Fig 2.10). Calmodulin-dependent protein kinases are abundant in the postsynaptic density. Overexpression of CaMKII can dramatically increase synaptic strength as it is a major regulator of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) processes108,109. Previous studies have found that knockout mice without Calmodulin-dependent protein kinases CaMKIIA demonstrate a low amplitude of LTP110. However, even though calmodulin-binding activity is reduced in the FMR1-KO mice, I did not observe a reduction in synaptic strength at the CA3-CA1 synapse (as measured by maximum fEPSP slope) with avoidance learning or with FMR1-KO (Fig. 2.8). Limitations \u00b6 There are some limitations to this study. To obtain a sufficient samples size for the behavioral and transcriptomic experiments in the time frame allotted from our summer collaboration, we processed animals in both the morning and in the evening. We aimed to have a balanced design to control for any effects of time of day. However, when running an analysis of weighted gene co-expression of the effect of genotype and time of day, it became clear that daytime had a strong effect. Hundreds of genes show patterns of co-regulation that are significantly correlated with the time of day (data not shown) which may mask differences in gene expression due to genotype. Another possible limitation of this study is related to the chose of statistical methods for analysis of group differences. To test my hypotheses, I needed to compare consistent and conflict mice from WT and FMR1-KO mice. However, rather than only compare these groups, I included the yoked groups in all ANOVA and post-hoc analyses. This means that some statistical power was given to assessing uninteresting things like differences between yoked groups. While I believe that included all groups in the analysis provided a more accurate representation of the data, one could argue that different statistical analysis are indeed equally or more appropriate. Conclusions \u00b6 Despite a slow initial learning curve, the wild-type mice show a clear use of place memory and memory discrimination solve the active place avoidance task. Hippocampal-dependent place avoidance strategies are not the way to successfully avoid aversive stimuli. Animals that are indifferent to the place of the shock zone will be indifferent to changes in its location and thus will not be challenged to demonstrate behavioral flexibility. FMR1-KO mice demonstrate the use of a non-place strategy by successfully avoiding the shock zone without ever showing evidence of a place memory. By preferring to use non-place strategies, FMR1-KO animals are unlikely to depend on hippocampus for their adaptive behavior and instead demonstrate adaptive but fixed (inflexible) behavior that can be an effective general purpose solution to their cognitive challenges although it is not optimal. This interpretation predicts that across the entire conflict protocol the WT and FMR1-KO groups will receive similar amounts of punishment; however, the FMR1-KO punishment is constant and intermediate across trials whereas the WT is large at the start and lower at the end. I demonstrated that FMR1 knockout, which is known to disrupt local translation in the hippocampus, also alters gene expression in the CA1 subfield. By reproducing the results of a recently published study, I was able to compare both studies to identify robust pattern of downregulation of genes related to calcium ion signaling. Even though FMRP is typically thought to disrupt translation, my data suggest that FMRP loss also has effects on the upstream process of gene expression. More research is needed to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of place memory and non-place memory strategies for solving cognitive tasks.

The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which encodes fragile x mental retardation protein (FMRP), a protein that regulates the local translation of a subset of mRNAs at synapses. In the absence of FMRP, dysregulated mRNA translation can lead to altered synaptic function, loss of protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity, and impaired cognitive discrimination. To better understand the effects of silencing the FMR1 gene, I analyzed learning behavior and hippocampal gene expression. I confirmed that genetic knock out of FMR1 (FMR1-KO) alters the expression of avoidance behavior in a way that indicates that FMR1-KO mice do not use hippocampal place memory to avoid the shock zone. Contrary to previously published results, initial learning was not very robust during this experiment, possibly due to working in a \u201cnoisy\u201d environment where environmental distractions made learning difficult. I identified 20 genes whose expression in the CA1 hippocampal subfield was altered by constitutive knockout of FMR1. Using a meta-analysis with published data, I found a consistent and reproducible pattern of downregulation of expression Efcab and Sperpina3n and altered calcium signaling in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. These results suggest that despite the proximal effects of FMR1 knockout being on translation dysregulation, loss of FMRP also leads to transcriptional dysregulation, involving multiple genes that contribute to autism spectrum disorder. Additional research is needed to understand how the loss of FMR1 activity affects hippocampal-dependent memory use.","title":"ABSTRACT"},{"location":"02_fmr1/#introduction","text":"Fragile X syndrome is the most prevalent form of genetically inherited intellectual disability89. This X-linked disorder is caused by mutations in the untranslated region of the FMR1 gene resulting in a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion higher than 200 that gives rise to hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing90. Thus, patients with fragile X syndrome do not make the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Autistic-like features and problems with working and short-term memory are frequent in patients with fragile X syndrome91. Impaired memory discrimination is thought to lead to exaggerated responses to environmental changes in autistic patients. Autism spectrum disorder is a genetically heterogeneous condition. While many genes predisposing an individual with autism spectrum disorder have been identified, an understanding of the causal disease mechanism remains elusive92. A deeper understanding of the molecular interaction between fmr1 in a brain region-specific manner might shed light on phenotypic variation. FMRP regulates the local translation of a subset of about 400 mRNAs at synapses93. In the absence of FMRP, dysregulated mRNA translation leads to altered synaptic function and loss of protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity89. Voineagu et al. 2011 found that striking regional patterns of attenuated gene expression in the frontal and temporal cortex, suggesting abnormalities in cortical patterning94. FMR1-KO mice95 show that cognitive discrimination deficits are prominent, but learning and memory themselves appear unimpaired55. Cognitive discrimination requires distinguishing between similar but distinct experiences. To better understand the effects of silencing the FMR1 gene, I analyzed hippocampal gene expression and cognitive behavior including learning memory and cognitive discrimination. I investigated cognitive discrimination by changing the location of a mild shock, requiring the subjects to distinguish between the current and prior locations of shock. I hypothesized that FMR1-KO would alter cognitive discrimination performance and the activity of hundreds of genes in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. To evaluate these predictions, I used an active place avoidance task to measure the behavioral correlates of learning, memory, and cognitive discrimination. Then, I analyzed ex vivo hippocampus electrophysiological data to estimate changes in CA3-CA1 synaptic strength. Next, I identified patterns of differential gene expression in the CA1 subfield as a result of constitutive FMR1 knockout. Finally, I reproduced the finding of a recently published96 study of gene expression in the FMR1-KO hippocampus, and I compared my reproduction of the Ceolin study to my own finding to identify robust patterns of FMR1 dependent gene expression in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. This approach provides a blueprint for investigation of the behavior, physiology, and molecular consequences of FMRP loss in a rodent model. The data, analysis tools, and results are publically available for readers to investigate independently97.","title":"INTRODUCTION"},{"location":"02_fmr1/#methods","text":"All animal care and use procedures comply with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the New York University Animal Welfare Committee and the Marine Biological Laboratory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The behavioral paradigm was explicitly designed to constrain animal behavior to provide hypothesis-driven insight into the role of FMRP in cognition. In this task, yoked mice and trained mice experience the same physical world, but they have a different internal representation of the world as expressed by their spatial use of the active place avoidance arena. The use of consistent and conflict training allows the experimenter to tease apart initial avoidance learning and cognitive discrimination. All mice were exposed to nine sessions in the active place avoidance arena (Fig. 2.1). Mice were placed on an elevated circular (40 cm diameter) arena that rotated at 1 rpm. The arena wall was transparent and thus contained the mice to the arena while allowing them to observe the environment. The location of the mouse in the arena was determined by a PC-controlled video tracking system (Bio-Signal Group Corp.) using an overhead video camera. Consistently trained mice in the active place avoidance task are conditioned to avoid mild shocks (constant current 0.2 mA, 60 Hz, 500 ms) that can be localized by visual cues in the environment. Yoked mice are delivered a sequence of unavoidable shocks that reproduces the time series of shocks received by the trained mice; however, the shocks delivered to the mice cannot be localized to any consistent places in the environment. All sessions in the arena last 10 minutes. Mice were allowed to become familiar with walking on the rotating arena during a 10 min \u2018Pre-training session'. Then mice undergo three, 10-min avoidance-training sessions separated by a two h inter-trial interval. Mice are returned to their home cage overnight.

The first, fundamental hypothesis is that the mice are using a strategy that utilizes place memory to avoid shock. If, and only if, they are using place memory, then the conflict task allows us to assess how well they discriminate between memory for the initial location of shock and the current relocated position of shock (Fig. A4). The rationale is as follows: If the mice are using place memory to avoid the initial location of shock, then they will have learned the specific location of shock. By avoiding the location itself, they avoid shock without experiencing it. The behavior would be characterized by avoidance of the shock location rather than escape of shock itself. Alternatively, the mice could be avoiding shock by escaping after receiving shock rather than by using memory of the location to avoid it. Here their behavior would be characterized by escape but not by avoidance. I distinguish between these two possibilities by measuring the number of entrances, the length of the path to first entrance, and the probability of being in the shock zone? If the mice are using place memory, then moving the shock zone to another place should make their memory no longer adaptive and their ability to avoid shock should be disturbed. Alternatively, if they were merely escaping shock without regard for exactly where it is, then they should not be disturbed by changing the shock zone at all as their strategy of effectively responding to shock should be equally effective after the shock was relocated to the opposite part of the environment, as in the conflict sessions (Fig. A4). There was a clear difference in the number of entrances by WT consistent and WT conflict trained groups, indicating first that the WT mice used place memory to avoid shock during the initial training trials. Because the number of entrances decreased during conflict training, this indicates that WT mice used cognitive discrimination to distinguish between their memory for the initial location of shock and their memory for the current location of shock (Fig 2.5B, 2.6A, 2.6B.

Both consistent and conflict WT groups perform equally well by the third conflict session on Day 2 (Fig. 2.6A, 2.6B). Together, these data suggest that wild-type mice use a hippocampal-dependent place avoidance strategy to solve the task. Thus, wild-type mice that are conflict-trained show evidence of memory discrimination by using spatial orientation to avoid the shock zone on Day 1 and Day 2 when the environment shifts. On the other hand, FMR1-KO mice performed the task well on Day1 as evidenced by the trained mice displaying fewer entrances into the shock zone during initial training (Fig. 2.5C). However, FMR1-KO animals appear to never use place memory as a strategy for solving this task of avoiding the shock zone during any of the training sessions with the shock on (Fig. 2.5F). Additionally, the conflict-trained animals do not show evidence of discriminating between the first and the second location of the shock zone. Conflict trained FMR1-KO mice do not perform more poorly on the task than consistently trained FMR1-KO mice (Fig. 2.6A, 2.6B) indicating that they do not have to discriminate between place memories of the old and new shock zone. The weak learning demonstrated by the WT mice may or may not have been due to extraneous factors in the room that suppressed initial learning. Whatever the cause, it gave the FMR1-KO mice the opportunity to demonstrate a non-hippocampal dependent place avoidance strategy that was a successful way to solve the task.

Glutamate receptors are known to influence long-term synaptic modulation by stimulating the synthesis of synaptic proteins, including postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) and FMRP101\u2013104. The expression of genes involved in calcium ion binding appear to be downregulated in FMR1-KO mice. The gene encoding the pore-forming \u03b11 subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel (Cacna1g) is also among the list of down-regulated genes in my study. SNPs in Cacna1g and other calcium channel genes have been found to be associated with autism spectrum disorder105\u2013107. The gene Efcab6 (EF-Hand Calcium Binding Domain 6) encode a protein that is involved with calcium ion binding and transcriptional regulation. Calcium binding and calcium transport are also notably on the list of molecular functions that are significantly downregulated in FMR1-KO mice in both this study (Fig 2.8C) and my reproduction of the Ceolin study (Fig 2.10). Calmodulin-dependent protein kinases are abundant in the postsynaptic density. Overexpression of CaMKII can dramatically increase synaptic strength as it is a major regulator of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) processes108,109. Previous studies have found that knockout mice without Calmodulin-dependent protein kinases CaMKIIA demonstrate a low amplitude of LTP110. However, even though calmodulin-binding activity is reduced in the FMR1-KO mice, I did not observe a reduction in synaptic strength at the CA3-CA1 synapse (as measured by maximum fEPSP slope) with avoidance learning or with FMR1-KO (Fig. 2.8).","title":"Neural-transcriptomics"},{"location":"02_fmr1/#limitations","text":"There are some limitations to this study.

However, when running an analysis of weighted gene co-expression of the effect of genotype and time of day, it became clear that daytime had a strong effect. Hundreds of genes show patterns of co-regulation that are significantly correlated with the time of day (data not shown) which may mask differences in gene expression due to genotype. Another possible limitation of this study is related to the chose of statistical methods for analysis of group differences. To test my hypotheses, I needed to compare consistent and conflict mice from WT and FMR1-KO mice. However, rather than only compare these groups, I included the yoked groups in all ANOVA and post-hoc analyses.

Hippocampal-dependent place avoidance strategies are not the way to successfully avoid aversive stimuli. Animals that are indifferent to the place of the shock zone will be indifferent to changes in its location and thus will not be challenged to demonstrate behavioral flexibility. FMR1-KO mice demonstrate the use of a non-place strategy by successfully avoiding the shock zone without ever showing evidence of a place memory. By preferring to use non-place strategies, FMR1-KO animals are unlikely to depend on hippocampus for their adaptive behavior and instead demonstrate adaptive but fixed (inflexible) behavior that can be an effective general purpose solution to their cognitive challenges although it is not optimal. This interpretation predicts that across the entire conflict protocol the WT and FMR1-KO groups will receive similar amounts of punishment; however, the FMR1-KO punishment is constant and intermediate across trials whereas the WT is large at the start and lower at the end. I demonstrated that FMR1 knockout, which is known to disrupt local translation in the hippocampus, also alters gene expression in the CA1 subfield. By reproducing the results of a recently published study, I was able to compare both studies to identify robust pattern of downregulation of genes related to calcium ion signaling. Even though FMRP is typically thought to disrupt translation, my data suggest that FMRP loss also has effects on the upstream process of gene expression.

ABSTRACT \u00b6 Single-neuron gene expression studies may be especially important for understanding nervous system structure and function because of the neuron-specific functionality and plasticity that defines functional neural circuits. Cellular dissociation is a prerequisite single-cell sequencing analysis, but the extent to which this process alters the molecular activity in neural tissues has not been determined. This information is necessary for interpreting the results of experimental manipulations that affect neural function such as learning and memory. Here, I quantified the transcriptomic response to cellular dissociation in tissue samples from the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 hippocampus subfields relative to tissues that have been homogenized for whole tissue analysis. I determined that 1% of the hippocampal tissue transcriptome is altered by the process of cellular dissociation. Next, I compared this 'dissociation-induced' gene-expression response to previously described changes in hippocampal subfield expression in response to stressful experience and cognitive training. I found that chemical dissociation response is greater than the transcriptomic response to a stressful experience but weaker than cognitive training. Finally, I compared our findings against a database of gene expression for single-cell population expression in DG, CA1, and CA1. This meta-analysis identified genes whose expression varies by subfield and by treatment. The important contribution of this paper to the literature is that I begin to describe concordant and discordant effects of technical and behavioral manipulations which will inform the design of future single-neuron transcriptome studies to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of brain function. INTRODUCTION \u00b6 Nervous systems are comprised of diverse cell types that include neurons, glia, and vascular cells, each serving distinct functions and thus expressing different genes. Consider the hippocampus, a structure central for spatial navigation and the processing of event memory in the mammalian brain. To date, distinct aspects of navigation and memory processing have been firmly correlated to activity of particular cellular subfields within the hippocampal formation. This subfield-specific understanding of hippocampal function has led to the notion that cells within a given subfield are homogeneous in their molecular blueprint and perform the same function. However, even within the anatomically-defined subfield of CA1, there are identifiable subclasses of pyramidal cells that belong to distinct functional circuits 19,20. This diversity is even greater when I consider that specific cells within a functional class can be selectively altered by neural activity in the recent or distant past. For example, only a third of the pyramidal cells of the superficial CA1 sub-layer is expected to be activated by experience, and only a subset of those will undergo synaptic strengthening to trigger further gene expression changes 21,22. All this diversity implies distinctive gene expression, very likely at the level of single neurons, and such considerations may curtail interpretations of gene expression studies that use mixtures of cells or microdissected tissue samples. Fortunately, recent advances in tissue processing and sequencing technologies have allowed genome-wide analysis of single cells in the context of brain and behavior studies 23\u201325. These approaches have led to systems-level insights into the molecular substrates of neural function, along with the discovery or validation of candidate pathways regulating physiology and behavior (Cembrowski et al., 2016). While the complexity of some tissues complicates the interpretation of transcriptome data collected from samples containing hundreds to tens of thousands of cells representing numerous cellular subclasses at different levels of diversity, difficulties with interpretation can be minimized by careful experimental design governing both data collection and data analysis. To complement this effort, and optimize experimental designs, it is necessary to understand the extent to which the treatment of tissue samples before transcriptome analysis might confound interpretation of the results. I examined the effect of cellular dissociation on the transcriptomes of specific hippocampal subfields (CA1, CA3, and DG) by comparing tissue homogenization (as a control) and cellular dissociation protocols. Next, I compared this 'dissociation-induced' gene-expression effect to the effect of prior stressful experience that accompanies many protocols to assess learning, memory and innate behaviors, and cognitive training on hippocampal subfield gene expression. Finally, I compared our results against a database of gene expression for single-cell population expression in DG, CA1, and CA1 to further validate the patterns of gene expression that I identified. Knowing how technical perturbations influence the ability to detect the molecular signature of differences in neural and behavioral variables is a significant step in calibrating the ability to mechanistically understand hippocampal function. In addition to understanding the impact of cell dissociation and stressful experience on hippocampus gene expression, the present findings allow evaluating the extent to which gene expression profiles of heterogeneous tissue samples compared with single neuron gene expression profiles. The important contribution of this paper to the literature is that I begin to describe concordant and discordant effects of technical and behavioral manipulations which will inform the design of future single-neuron transcriptome studies to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of brain function. METHODS \u00b6 All animal care and use complies with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the New York University Animal Welfare Committee. Sample processing \u00b6 A 1-year old C57BL/6J mouse was taken from its cage, anesthetized with 2% (vol/vol) isoflurane for 2 minutes and decapitated. Transverse 300 \u03bcm brain slices were cut using a vibratome (model VT1000 S, Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) and incubated at 36\u00b0C for 30 min and then at room temperature for 90 min in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4 and 25 Glucose) 5,6. Two adjacent tissue samples were collected from CA1, CA3, and DG, respectively in the dorsal hippocampus by a punch tool (0.25 mm, P/N: 57391; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). The \u2018control samples' were homogenized by pestle in the homogenization solution provided by Maxwell 16 LEV RNA Isolation Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The \u2018cellular dissociation samples' were incubated for 75 minutes in aCSF containing 1 mg/ml pronase at room temperature, vortexed, centrifuged, and terminated by replacing aCSF containing pronase with aCSF. The sample was then vortexed, centrifuged, and gently triturated by 200-\u03bcl pipette tip twenty times in aCSF containing 1% FBS. This sample was centrifuged and added to the homogenization solution using the Maxwell 16 LEV RNA Isolation Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Frozen samples were sent arena to The University of Texas for RNA isolation as per the manufacturer instruction (Maxwell 16 LEV RNA Isolation Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA libraries were prepared by the Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Facility at the University of Texas at Austin using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Bioinformatics \u00b6 Raw reads were processed and analyzed on the Stampede Cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Facility (TACC). Quality of the data was checked using the program FASTQC. Low-quality reads and contaminating adapter sequences were removed using the program Cutadapt 7. I obtained an average of 5 million reads for each hippocampal tissue sample and quantified the expression representing 22,485 genes in the mouse reference transcriptome M11. I used Kallisto for pseudo-alignment of reads and transcript counting using the-the Gencode M11 mouse transcriptome 8,9. The code used for this is described in (Harris et al 207 and on GitHub at https://github.com/raynamharris/DissociationTest/tree/master/UNIXworkflow. Statistics and Data Visualization \u00b6 I used DESeq2 with for normalization and quantification of gene counts with a false discovery corrected (FDR) p-value < 0.2 11,12,13. Principal component analyses (PCA) and hierarchical clustering were used to describe broad patterns of variation 14,15,10,16,12,14,17. I used GO_MWU 18 using a \u2013log(p-value) as a continuous measure of significance to identify gene ontology categories that are significantly enriched with either up- or down-regulated genes for a given two-way contrast. Meta-analysis \u00b6 I downloaded the gene counts from the Cembrowski et al. (2016) dataset (NCBI GEO: GSE74985) and the Harris et al. (2017) dataset (NCBI GEO: GSE99765). Briefly, the Cembrowski dataset contains hippocampal gene expression data for pools of 112 \u00b1 six cells for each of 5 cell types (CA1, CA2, and CA3 pyramidal neurons and DG mossy and granule cells) from behaviorally naive, transgenic mice that express a fluorescent protein label in the specific cell types. Fluorescently-labeled DG, CA3, and CA1 neurons from dorsal and ventral hippocampi were manually sorted (DG granule cells from Rbp4-Cre KL100, CA3 pyramidal cells from Mpp3-Cre KG118, and CA1 pyramidal cells from Vipr2-Cre KE2 mice.) The Harris et al. dataset contains DG, CA3, and CA1 transcriptomes from homecage mice, cognitively trained mice, and yoked control mice. The homecage mice were not examine in previous chapters thus a novel comparison between homecage and yoked controls can be made. The same statistical analyzes described in the previous section were run on these Cembrowski and Harris datasets to identity differentially expressed genes (FRD p-value < 0.1) in subfields of the hippocampus. I created a binary (0 or 1) list of genes that were significant or not for a GO enrichment analysis using Fisher's exact test to determine if GO categories are overrepresented among the significantly expressed genes. Archival of data, code, and figures \u00b6 I archived the raw sequence data and intermediate data files in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus Database (accession numbers GSE99765 and GSE100225). The data, code, and results are openly available on GitHub (https://github.com/raynamharris/DissociationTest), with an archived version at the time of publication available at Zenodo 26. All Illustrations and multi-panel figures were archived in FigShare under a CC-BY license 27\u201330. RESULTS \u00b6 The effects of cellular dissociation \u00b6 I identified 162 genes that were differentially expressed between the control and dissociated samples, 331 genes that were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between any of the three hippocampus subfields, and 30 genes were shared between both sets of differentially expressed genes at p-value < 0.05 (Fig 1A, B). A hierarchical clustering analysis of all differentially expressed genes does not give rise to distinct clusters that are separated by subfield or method; however, when examining the control, homogenized samples alone (identified with light grey boxes), the three subfields form distinct clusters, while the dissociated samples do not cluster by subfield (Fig. 1C). A principal component analysis of normalized gene counts reveals that PC1 accounts for 40% of the variation and visually separates the DG samples from the CA1 and CA3 samples (Fig. 1D). To confirm statistical significance of this visual pattern, I conducted a two-way treatment x region ANOVA and confirmed a significant effect of region (F2,11= 17.69; p = 0.0004). Post hoc Tukey tests confirmed CA1 = CA3 < DG. The effect of treatment and the treatment x region interaction were not significant. PC2 accounts for 22% of the variation in gene expression and varies significantly with treatment (F1,12=6.125; p = 0.03) but not by region or the treatment x region interaction. None of the other PCs showed significant variation according to either region or treatment. The effects of stressful experience \u00b6 I examined the effect of stressful experience, which is a common confound of behavioral manipulations because animals in different experimental groups often experience varying levels of stress, especially if the experimental procedure is not intentionally stressful. I identified 0 genes that were significantly expressed between samples from the home cage and shocked mouse samples; 1669 genes were significantly differentially expressed between any of the three brain regions at p-value < 0.05 (Fig. 2A, B). Hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed genes gives rise to three distinct clusters corresponding to the three subfields, with CA1 (purple) and CA3 (green) being more similar to one another than to DG (orange), whereas the effects of the stress manipulation were not distinctive (Fig. 2C). Fig. 3.1: The effect of cellular dissociation. A) From a single female mouse, I collected 2 CA1, CA3, and DG hippocampal tissue samples. One sample was subjected to a cellular dissociation treatment (dissociated) whereas the control samples (control) were standardly homogenized. B) I identified 162 dissociation-induced changes in gene expression, 331 genes with region-specific expression patterns, and 30 genes differentially expressed by both region and treatment (FDR p-value < 0.05). C) Hierarchical clustering separates the hippocampal subfields of the homogenized samples (light gray) but not the dissociated samples (dark gray). D) PC1 accounts for 40% of all gene expression variation and, by inspection, separates the DG samples from the CA1 and CA3 samples. PC2 accounts for 22% of the variation in gene expression and varies significantly with treatment. Ellipses are hand-drawn. \u00b6 Next, I conducted a principal component analysis of all the genes that were measured. PC1 accounts for 31% of the variation and by inspection, separates the DG samples from the CA1 and CA3 samples (effect of subfield: F2,15= 42.89; p < 0.001; Fig. 2D). Post hoc Tukey tests confirmed CA1 = CA3 \u2260 DG. The effects of stress and the stress x subfield interaction were not significant. PC2 accounts for 18% of the variation and varies significantly between CA1 and CA3 and CA1 and DG (effect of region: F2,15= 11.41; p < 0.001; Tukey tests: CA1 \u2260 DG = CA3). The effects of stress and the stress x region interaction were not significant. PC3 accounts for 15% of the variation and also explains some subfield-specific differences (effect of region: F2,15= 6.315; p < 0.01; Tukey tests: CA1 = DG \u2260 CA3), whereas effects of stress and the stress x region interaction were not significant. PC4 is also influenced by region (F2,15= 6.315; p = 0.0102; Tukey tests: CA1 \u2260 CA3. PC5 did not account for any significant differences according to region or treatment. PC6 significantly accounted for variance associated with the effect of a stressful experience (F1,16> 4.774; p\u2019s < 0.04). Fig. 3.2: The effects of a stressful experience. A) I compared CA1, CA3, and DG tissue samples from control mice taken directly from their home cage to mice that were subjected to a mild foot shock. B) I identified 0 genes that responded to treatment, and 1669 genes that were differentially regulated across regions of the hippocampus (FDR p-value < 0.05). C) Hierarchical clusters groups samples by brain region but distinct treatments clusters are not present. D) PC1 accounts for 31% of the variation and visually separates the DG samples from the CA1 and CA3 samples. PC2 accounts for 18% of the variation and distinguish the three subfields. Ellipses were hand-drawn. \u00b6 The effects of cognitive training \u00b6 I identified that 423 genes were differentially expressed between the yoked control and cognitively trained animals, 3485 genes that were differentially expressed across subfields, and 324 showed an interaction at FDR p < 0.05 (Fig. 2A, B). I see a large effect of brain region on gene expression, with 20% of detectable genes being differentially expressed between one or more brain-region comparisons (3485 differentially expressed genes /17320 measured genes). This is an order of magnitude greater than the 2% of the transcriptome that changed in response to learning (423 DEGs /17320 genes measured). Hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed genes separates samples by both subfield and treatment (Fig. 2C). A principal component analysis of all gene expression data revealed that brain region explains 75% of the variance in the data (Fig. 2D). PC1 accounts for 56% of the variance and distinguishes DG from the Ammon\u2019s horn samples (effect of subfield: F2,19= 226.1; p < 0.001; Tukey tests: DG \u2260 CA3 = CA1 ), but the effects of training and the training x region interaction were not significant. PC2 accounts for 19% of the variance and distinguishes the three subfields (effect of region: F2,19= 255.3; p < 0.001; Tukey tests: DG \u2260 CA3 \u2260 CA1). PC3 and PC4 indicate a significant influence of cognitive training (PC3: F1,20=7.451; p = 0.01,) and (PC4: F1,20=10.11; p = 0.005), but no significant effects of region and the region x treatment interaction. Fig. 3.3: The effects of learned avoidance behavior. A) Mice used in this study were either subjected to random but mild foot shocks (control) or subjected to mild foot shocks conditioned with spatial cues (trained). Tissue samples were collected from CA1, CA3, and DG. B) I identified only 423 genes that were significantly expressed according to cognitive training and identified 3485 genes that were differentially expressed between any of the three brain regions (FDR p-value <0.05). C) Hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed genes gives rise to three distinct clusters corresponding to the three brain regions, with CA1 and CA3 being more similar to one another than to DG. D) A principal component analysis of all genes in the analysis (regardless of the level of significance) shows that PC1 accounts for 56% of the variation and visually distinguishes the DG samples and the CA1 and CA3. PC2 accounts for 19% of the variation and separates all three subfields. Ellipses were hand-drawn. \u00b6 Identifying unique and general patterns of hippocampal genomic plasticity \u00b6 Next, I examined the overlap in genomic response to the technical and biological perturbations. I identified three specific genes that responded to both cellular dissociation and cognitive training: Grin2a, Epha6, and Ltbp3 (Fig. 4A). There was no overlap in differentially expressed genes compared to the cellular dissociation treatment (Fig. 4A). Then, analyzed gene ontology at 5% FDR significant in each of the data sets to identify the molecular function of genes that changed in response to cellular dissociation (Fig. 4B) or cognitive training (Fig. 4C). The process of cellular dissociation results in a significant upregulation of molecular processes related to ribosomal activity, rRNA binding, oxidoreductase activity, and proton transport, while it caused a down-regulation of ligase and helicase activity (Fig. 4B). Fig. 3.4: Overlapping responses to technical and biological perturbations. A) The number of genes that responded to chemical dissociation (163 genes), a stressful experience (0 genes), and cognitive training (423 genes). The three genes that respond to both technical and biological perturbation are Epha6, Grin2a, and Itbp3. B, C) The molecular function of gene ontology (GO) categories that are significantly enriched with either up- or down-regulated genes in response to cellular dissociation (B) or cognitive training (C). The top 10 most significant GO terms are visualized, each with a p-value < 0.001. The fraction next to GO category name indicates the fraction of genes in that category that survived a 10% FDR threshold for significance. Zero terms survived a 10% FDR threshold in response to a stressful experience. \u00b6 The GO analysis detected no Molecular Function GO terms in the significantly overrepresented genes in response to the stressful experience. Cognitive training resulted in a significant upregulation of molecular processes related to glutamate receptors, signal transduction, calcium binding, and membrane transport, and it resulted in a significant downregulation of ribosomal activity, oxidoreductase activity, mRNA binding, and proton transport (Fig. 4B). Fig. 3.5: Meta-analysis of primary and public data. A) This Venn diagram shows the overlap in brain-region specific gene expression across all four experiments (cellular dissociation, stressor habitation, cognitive training, and a public dataset examining subfield comparisons). Using this approach, I identified 146 genes that were differentially expressed between any two subfields of the hippocampus in all four experiments. B) Those 146 provide robust brain-region specific markers of gene expression belong to molecular function and cellular compartment GO. The top 10 most significant GO terms are visualized, each with a p-value < 0.05. The fraction next to GO category name indicates the fraction of genes in that category that survived a 10% FDR threshold for significance. \u00b6 The gene ontology analysis identified 91 significant GO terms in response to cognitive training. Among the top 10 are glutamate signaling and membrane transport systems and a downregulation of oxidoreductase and ribosomal activity (Fig. 4C). Notably, learning induces a downregulation of a structural constituent of ribosomes and oxidoreductase, which were both up-regulated in response to cellular dissociation (Fig. 4B, C). Using the public Cembrowski et al. 2016 dataset, I identified 10,751 genes that were differentially expressed between hippocampal sub-regions (Fig. 5A). Using a meta-analysis of public the primary data, I identified 146 genes that showed robust subfield-specific gene expression patterns (Fig. 5A). Those 146 genes are enriched in cellular compartments related to synapses and molecular functions related to calcium signaling, GTP exchange, and proteoglycan binding (Fig. 5B). DISCUSSION \u00b6 The primary purposes of this study were 1) to test whether analysis of gene expression in hippocampus subfields is changed by tissue preparation procedures (cellular dissociation versus homogenization) and 2) to evaluate the effects of a stressful experience relative to cognitive training on analysis of gene expression. The work was designed to evaluate the extent to which technical (i.e., cellular dissociation) and biological confounds (i.e., stressful experience) can impact efforts to assess the transcriptomic response to cognitive processes. This is potentially important because it is increasingly necessary to conduct molecular analyses of single-cells. Hippocampal subfield differences are well known 31\u201334. Across the three experiments with different treatments, the identity of the hippocampal subfield explained between 40 and 75% of all the variation in gene expression across samples (Fig 1D, 2D, 3D). The samples that were subjected to cellular dissociation show the least amount of region-specific variation, suggesting that this process might alter the genes that typically distinguish the hippocampal subfields from one another. On the other hand, the Cembrowski et al., (2015) study identified a larger number of genes with subfield specificity; this is likely due to the cell sorting process that generates a relatively homogenous rather than a heterogeneous population of neurons. These results indicate that cell-type specific differences may be recovered by sorting cells from very heterogenous tissues into more homogeneous populations of cells. Across the datasets, many genes consistently or robustly demonstrate hippocampal subfield specificity in their expression (Fig. 5B). The meta-analysis of the primary data and the public Cembrowski et al., (2016) data identified 146 genes that could potentially serve as robust subfield specific markers. The molecular functions of these potential marker genes are diverse, related to calcium channel regulation, proteoglycan binding, and guanyl-nucleotide (GTP) exchange, as well as cellular compartment categories related to the synapse and the postsynaptic density. This suggests that the phenotypic and functional differences amongst DG, CA3, and CA1 neurons may be driven or influenced by subfield differences in gene expression. Concerning the effects of cellular dissociation of hippocampal gene expression, I found that 0.9% (162/16,709) of the genes measured changed in response to cellular dissociation (Fig. 1B). This is smaller than the 2.4% (423 /17,320) change I detected in response to cognitive training (Fig. 2B). The stressful experience produces a negligible response (i.e., no significant genes or GO terms were detected), indicating that the mild stress that likely accompanies most behavioral tasks does not have a lasting influence on hippocampal gene expression (Fig. 2B). The extent to which cellular dissociation and unintended stress impact the expression of particular genes and signaling pathways limits the feasibility of investigating how genes contribute to behavior and other responses to organismal manipulations. I found that Grin2a responded to both cellular dissociation and cognitive training (Fig. 4A). Grin2a encodes subunits of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type ionotropic glutamate receptors that are crucial for numerous cellular functions throughout the brain, including hippocampus-dependent synaptic plasticity and learning 35,36. Accordingly, care should be taken when studying the role of glutamate and MAPK signaling in combination with cellular dissociation techniques. Epha6 and Ltbp3 also responded to both cellular dissociation and cognitive training (Fig. 4A). Epha6 is involved with the MAPK-Erk signaling pathway. Ltbp3 participates in binding calcium ions and shows altered gene expression in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease 37. I can look beyond the specific genes and examine which pathway responses are concordant or discordant to multiple treatments. In this case, I saw upregulation of ribosomal activity and rRNA biding in response to cellular dissociation, but I saw an opposing downregulation in ribosomal activity and mRNA binding in response to cognitive training (Fig. 4B,C). This suggests that cellular dissociation activates a general transcriptional response whereas cognitive training reduces the transcription of particular protein-coding genes. This demonstrates the possibility that such an interaction, in this case a downregulation in response to cognitive training could be overshadowed by technical artifacts if hippocampus tissue is first subjected to the cellular dissociation required for single-cell or single cell population investigations. I found no detectable transcriptional response in the CA1, CA3, or DG following the stressful experience (Fig. 2B). The shock experience I used causes a substantial increase in plasma corticosterone levels, comparable to exposure to predator threat, that is observed after the initial shock exposure session but is absent 24-h later after the second training session 38. Our findings support the use of either home cage or shock-yoked animals as controls for active place avoidance training experiments. In the case of the homecage controls that do not experience shock, their stress response is indistinguishable from the trained mice, but their sensory experience is very different. In contrast, the shock-yoked mice have identical sensory experience as the experimental mice, but they experience stress that the experimental animals do not 38. It may be that untrained mice are ideal controls because they would have the identical experience of the environment as experimental mice, except at the brief 500 ms moments of shock that account for ~3% of the task assuming 20 shocks in 600 s. Depending on the question one control may be preferable over the others, but as demonstrated here, when assessed 24 h after the training experience, they appear to be equivalent regarding their gene expression profiles (Fig. 2). CONCLUSIONS \u00b6 Many factors contribute to variation in gene expression. I set out to identify the extent to which the process of cellular dissociation \u2013 which allows for single-cell analysis of neurons \u2013 has an appreciable effect on our ability to detect biologically meaningful variation in hippocampal gene expression. I conclude that there are specific dissociation-induced and cognitive training-induced changes in gene expression that are largely non-overlapping. It is encouraging that the overlap between cellular dissociation and cognitive training is small, indicating that these technical and biological processes affect different transcriptional processes. It is also gratifying to know that the stressful experience had no substantial effect on hippocampal gene expression because its generalization to other tasks will allow for using behavioral control groups and behavioral manipulations that also induce modest, potentially confounding stress. These findings provide insight into how cellular and biological manipulations influence gene expression. Through meta-analysis with open-access data, I have identified a subset of robust sub-region specific markers of gene expression profiling. Further research is needed to uncover the influence of other variables on variation in hippocampal gene expression.

This information is necessary for interpreting the results of experimental manipulations that affect neural function such as learning and memory. Here, I quantified the transcriptomic response to cellular dissociation in tissue samples from the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 hippocampus subfields relative to tissues that have been homogenized for whole tissue analysis.

Consider the hippocampus, a structure central for spatial navigation and the processing of event memory in the mammalian brain. To date, distinct aspects of navigation and memory processing have been firmly correlated to activity of particular cellular subfields within the hippocampal formation. This subfield-specific understanding of hippocampal function has led to the notion that cells within a given subfield are homogeneous in their molecular blueprint and perform the same function. However, even within the anatomically-defined subfield of CA1, there are identifiable subclasses of pyramidal cells that belong to distinct functional circuits 19,20. This diversity is even greater when I consider that specific cells within a functional class can be selectively altered by neural activity in the recent or distant past. For example, only a third of the pyramidal cells of the superficial CA1 sub-layer is expected to be activated by experience, and only a subset of those will undergo synaptic strengthening to trigger further gene expression changes 21,22. All this diversity implies distinctive gene expression, very likely at the level of single neurons, and such considerations may curtail interpretations of gene expression studies that use mixtures of cells or microdissected tissue samples. Fortunately, recent advances in tissue processing and sequencing technologies have allowed genome-wide analysis of single cells in the context of brain and behavior studies 23\u201325. These approaches have led to systems-level insights into the molecular substrates of neural function, along with the discovery or validation of candidate pathways regulating physiology and behavior (Cembrowski et al., 2016). While the complexity of some tissues complicates the interpretation of transcriptome data collected from samples containing hundreds to tens of thousands of cells representing numerous cellular subclasses at different levels of diversity, difficulties with interpretation can be minimized by careful experimental design governing both data collection and data analysis. To complement this effort, and optimize experimental designs, it is necessary to understand the extent to which the treatment of tissue samples before transcriptome analysis might confound interpretation of the results. I examined the effect of cellular dissociation on the transcriptomes of specific hippocampal subfields (CA1, CA3, and DG) by comparing tissue homogenization (as a control) and cellular dissociation protocols. Next, I compared this 'dissociation-induced' gene-expression effect to the effect of prior stressful experience that accompanies many protocols to assess learning, memory and innate behaviors, and cognitive training on hippocampal subfield gene expression. Finally, I compared our results against a database of gene expression for single-cell population expression in DG, CA1, and CA1 to further validate the patterns of gene expression that I identified. Knowing how technical perturbations influence the ability to detect the molecular signature of differences in neural and behavioral variables is a significant step in calibrating the ability to mechanistically understand hippocampal function. In addition to understanding the impact of cell dissociation and stressful experience on hippocampus gene expression, the present findings allow evaluating the extent to which gene expression profiles of heterogeneous tissue samples compared with single neuron gene expression profiles. The important contribution of this paper to the literature is that I begin to describe concordant and discordant effects of technical and behavioral manipulations which will inform the design of future single-neuron transcriptome studies to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of brain function.","title":"INTRODUCTION"},{"location":"03_dissociation/#methods","text":"All animal care and use complies with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the New York University Animal Welfare Committee.","title":"METHODS"},{"location":"03_dissociation/#sample-processing","text":"A 1-year old C57BL/6J mouse was taken from its cage, anesthetized with 2% (vol/vol) isoflurane for 2 minutes and decapitated.

The work was designed to evaluate the extent to which technical (i.e., cellular dissociation) and biological confounds (i.e., stressful experience) can impact efforts to assess the transcriptomic response to cognitive processes. This is potentially important because it is increasingly necessary to conduct molecular analyses of single-cells. Hippocampal subfield differences are well known 31\u201334. Across the three experiments with different treatments, the identity of the hippocampal subfield explained between 40 and 75% of all the variation in gene expression across samples (Fig 1D, 2D, 3D). The samples that were subjected to cellular dissociation show the least amount of region-specific variation, suggesting that this process might alter the genes that typically distinguish the hippocampal subfields from one another. On the other hand, the Cembrowski et al., (2015) study identified a larger number of genes with subfield specificity; this is likely due to the cell sorting process that generates a relatively homogenous rather than a heterogeneous population of neurons. These results indicate that cell-type specific differences may be recovered by sorting cells from very heterogenous tissues into more homogeneous populations of cells. Across the datasets, many genes consistently or robustly demonstrate hippocampal subfield specificity in their expression (Fig. 5B). The meta-analysis of the primary data and the public Cembrowski et al., (2016) data identified 146 genes that could potentially serve as robust subfield specific markers. The molecular functions of these potential marker genes are diverse, related to calcium channel regulation, proteoglycan binding, and guanyl-nucleotide (GTP) exchange, as well as cellular compartment categories related to the synapse and the postsynaptic density. This suggests that the phenotypic and functional differences amongst DG, CA3, and CA1 neurons may be driven or influenced by subfield differences in gene expression. Concerning the effects of cellular dissociation of hippocampal gene expression, I found that 0.9% (162/16,709) of the genes measured changed in response to cellular dissociation (Fig. 1B). This is smaller than the 2.4% (423 /17,320) change I detected in response to cognitive training (Fig. 2B). The stressful experience produces a negligible response (i.e., no significant genes or GO terms were detected), indicating that the mild stress that likely accompanies most behavioral tasks does not have a lasting influence on hippocampal gene expression (Fig. 2B). The extent to which cellular dissociation and unintended stress impact the expression of particular genes and signaling pathways limits the feasibility of investigating how genes contribute to behavior and other responses to organismal manipulations. I found that Grin2a responded to both cellular dissociation and cognitive training (Fig. 4A). Grin2a encodes subunits of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type ionotropic glutamate receptors that are crucial for numerous cellular functions throughout the brain, including hippocampus-dependent synaptic plasticity and learning 35,36. Accordingly, care should be taken when studying the role of glutamate and MAPK signaling in combination with cellular dissociation techniques. Epha6 and Ltbp3 also responded to both cellular dissociation and cognitive training (Fig. 4A). Epha6 is involved with the MAPK-Erk signaling pathway. Ltbp3 participates in binding calcium ions and shows altered gene expression in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease 37. I can look beyond the specific genes and examine which pathway responses are concordant or discordant to multiple treatments. In this case, I saw upregulation of ribosomal activity and rRNA biding in response to cellular dissociation, but I saw an opposing downregulation in ribosomal activity and mRNA binding in response to cognitive training (Fig. 4B,C). This suggests that cellular dissociation activates a general transcriptional response whereas cognitive training reduces the transcription of particular protein-coding genes. This demonstrates the possibility that such an interaction, in this case a downregulation in response to cognitive training could be overshadowed by technical artifacts if hippocampus tissue is first subjected to the cellular dissociation required for single-cell or single cell population investigations. I found no detectable transcriptional response in the CA1, CA3, or DG following the stressful experience (Fig. 2B). The shock experience I used causes a substantial increase in plasma corticosterone levels, comparable to exposure to predator threat, that is observed after the initial shock exposure session but is absent 24-h later after the second training session 38. Our findings support the use of either home cage or shock-yoked animals as controls for active place avoidance training experiments. In the case of the homecage controls that do not experience shock, their stress response is indistinguishable from the trained mice, but their sensory experience is very different. In contrast, the shock-yoked mice have identical sensory experience as the experimental mice, but they experience stress that the experimental animals do not 38. It may be that untrained mice are ideal controls because they would have the identical experience of the environment as experimental mice, except at the brief 500 ms moments of shock that account for ~3% of the task assuming 20 shocks in 600 s. Depending on the question one control may be preferable over the others, but as demonstrated here, when assessed 24 h after the training experience, they appear to be equivalent regarding their gene expression profiles (Fig. 2).","title":"DISCUSSION"},{"location":"03_dissociation/#conclusions","text":"Many factors contribute to variation in gene expression. I set out to identify the extent to which the process of cellular dissociation \u2013 which allows for single-cell analysis of neurons \u2013 has an appreciable effect on our ability to detect biologically meaningful variation in hippocampal gene expression. I conclude that there are specific dissociation-induced and cognitive training-induced changes in gene expression that are largely non-overlapping. It is encouraging that the overlap between cellular dissociation and cognitive training is small, indicating that these technical and biological processes affect different transcriptional processes. It is also gratifying to know that the stressful experience had no substantial effect on hippocampal gene expression because its generalization to other tasks will allow for using behavioral control groups and behavioral manipulations that also induce modest, potentially confounding stress. These findings provide insight into how cellular and biological manipulations influence gene expression. Through meta-analysis with open-access data, I have identified a subset of robust sub-region specific markers of gene expression profiling. Further research is needed to uncover the influence of other variables on variation in hippocampal gene expression.","title":"CONCLUSIONS"},{"location":"03_dissociation/#acknowledgments","text":"This work was carried out as part of the Neural Systems and Behavior Course Directors Research Program run by HAH and AAF at the Marine Biological Laboratory.

Identifying the molecular basis of individual phenotypic variation is a major challenge for modern biologists. This research provides fundamental new insights into how transcriptional variation arises both within the subfields of the hippocampus that are crucial for learning, memory, and cognition. As a whole, my research provides a thorough analysis of transcriptional activity in the hippocampus that confirms many known properties and suggests new avenues for research. What I found \u00b6 I found that the Dentate Gyrus (DG) subfield responses with a strong upregulation of transcription factors to consistently-reinforced active place avoidance training.

My results confirm that the well-known \u201cmemory molecules\u201d continue to appear on gene lists as essential, but my research builds on this prior work by identifying new genes who activity is related to processes involved in learning and memory. There appears to be robust sub-field specific difference that may reflect constitutive processes that distinguish the functional classes of neurons that make up each subfield. It will be interesting to see the extent to which other behavioral manipulations influence plasticity in gene expression. I found that knocking out the FMR1 gene (which is the leading known genetic cause of autism) causes a change in the strategy that mice use to solve place avoidance tasks, and it disrupts the expression of about 100 genes. Among the list of affected processes, calcium signaling appears to be downregulated, which may provide insight into how neural function, in general, is altered in the FMR1 knock out brain. Using automated computing and statistical analyses, I have developed an approach to investigate stable and plastic patterns of gene expression in the hippocampus. Using my data in combination with publically available data, I identified genes that reproducibly distinguish subfields of the hippocampus. I identified genes that respond indifferently to different types of manipulation and those that response only to specific treatments. This study is a significant contribution to our understanding of how experimental techniques may or may not mask our ability to identify biologically meaningful signatures of gene expression. Given who much I integrated public data into my analysis pipeline, I hope that future research can benefit from incorporating my now public data into their research for continued use and discovery. What I learned \u00b6 One idea that emerged from synthesizing the information of my thesis as a whole rather than each experiment individually is that stability is more common than plasticity in gene expression in brain expression. In other words, I expected to find thousands of genes showing significantly different expression with every manipulation, but what I found was that the effect of manipulation was much smaller than the gene expression differences that give rise to neuron-specific and region-specific patterns of expression in the brain (Chapter, 1, 2, and 3). I think reading the literature biased me always to expect to find large, significant, meaningful patterns of expression that were evidence of transcriptomic plasticity underlying behavioral plasticity. However, when I look at what explains most of the variation in expression, mostly its brain structure and cellular makeup that control differences, not acute response to experimental manipulations. A time series analysis could be the next step to examine how much transcriptomic dynamics there is at various milestones of the learning and memory formation process. Or, one could block transcription at different times during learning and memory formation to better understand how transcription influences learning or how laboratory manipulations interact to alter gene alter expression. Implications for broader scientific disciplines \u00b6 The research questions, approaches, and conclusions described in this thesis are useful in part to scientists and educators of all disciplines. My thesis research questions have their roots in behavioral neuroscience and integrative biology. I drew upon literature describing the neural circuitry of the hippocampus and its contribution to spatial learning and memory discrimination. I complement this logic with that of the brain and behavior schools of thought in integrative biology where one describes the wealth of behavioral differences between two populations and tries to identify the underlying genomic contribution to variation in behavior. I hope to see more cross-talk and collaboration between scientists who reduce their focus to deliberate manipulation of discrete molecular and those who study the random forces of evolutionary biology when trying to understand brain function. Vision for reproducible research \u00b6 In the future, I hope to see more large-scale databases of publically available gene expression data that facilitate meta-analysis of new and old data to test for reproducibility. Even though conducted three distinct experiments, I found it very useful to repeatedly analyze the data from all three thesis chapters to look for anomalies or to control for variables that were unexpectedly not controlled for by the experimental design. For the first time, I was also able to analyze my data together with publically available data to confirm general patterns of transcription in the hippocampus. This meta-analysis (presented in Chapter 3) was relatively simple once the data were formatted such that similar cell or tissue types could be compared against explanatory variables of interest. I would like to see more meta-analyses like this in the future, where scientists analyze primary and secondary data in the same paper. Journals like eLife have pioneered a platform where the reproduction of secondary data can be submitted as a stand-alone article, and badge systems are being developed to demonstrate when new research provides evidence that a previous study has been reproduced or replicated. With good good data management practices, I can look for patterns that were consistent and robust over time compared to those that are more variable. As I learned how to code with increasing elegance and skill, I continued to revisit old data with new emerging technology and with ever-evolving color palettes. In a supplementary analysis, I conducted a meta-analysis of behavior, looking for robust patterns of memory across experiments, years, researchers, and laboratories (Figs. A5, A6). This type of analysis gave me further insight into the biological meaning of the data and sparked new conversation with colleagues. PART II: PROFESSIONAL INSIGHT \u00b6 The impact of community-developed products and practices \u00b6 When I started out with my thesis research, I did not realize the extent to which the availability of open-source software tools and hardware for bioinformatics would impact the reproducibility of my workflow. Even though my computational workflows are publically available, and they have been reused by undergraduates at my university, these workflows are designed to be run on a specific cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Facility, that has been turbo-charged with in-house made scripts and programs made available through the BioITeam in coordination with the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at UT Austin. Thus, the computationally-expensive methods that I used are only useful to a specific community of academics. However, after I have wrangled and reduced the size of my next-generation sequencing data, I am empowered by the plethora of open source software tools designed by public and volunteer organizations such as the NCBI, Ensembl, the R User Community, Jupyter Org. This is a collaborative space where technologies grow and develop inside user communities, but they are used and contributed to by a global audience. Based on the foundation of knowledge, tools, and tutorials available on the internet, I was able to create a well-documented and reproducible workflow for gene expression analysis. The workflow is partially modularized so that you can mix and match programs to fit the needs of the experiment. I never knew how much I would enjoy the implementation of bioinformatics and data manipulation, and I am grateful to all the scientists who are committed to sharing their research outputs to support the scientific endeavors of other colleagues. The impact of research-driven education \u00b6 As an approach, both my laboratory and computational work was embedded in non-traditional classrooms. This means that I have six years of experience observing how experiments are carried out in research laboratories and teaching laboratories. All of my wet-laboratory experiments were conducted during June and July 2015 and July 2016 in conjunction with the Neural Systems & Behavior. For eight weeks each summer, I attended lectures in the morning and conducted research in a laboratory from noon to 10 pm. For two of those weeks, I also co-taught and mentored students in laboratory and bioinformatic techniques in integrative molecular neuroscience. Given that I have used my data to answer research questions and as a tool in the classroom, I believe that the resources and approach described in my thesis will be of relevance to other researchers and educators working with RNA sequencing data in particular or biological data in general. Additionally, I have seen first-hand what strategies work for teaching students the process of molecular biology rather than merely showing them how to follow recipes. I have also observed first-hand the success of short-term intense research education experiences. The courses offered by Cold Spring Harbor and the Marine Biological laboratory are crucial for helping students gain technical skills, knowledge, and a network of like-minded researchers128. Of course, semester-long university courses are an essential part of education, but I believe that graduate students should have all the financial support available to gain training during the summer and holiday breaks in the academic year. Importantly, the bioinformatic approaches I adopted also stemmed from being embedded in the non-traditional teaching communities known as Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry. Since 2015, I have undergone a dramatic transformation by learning how to use and teach multiple programing languages and best practices for data analysis in the modern biology era. As a student in their workshops, I learned how bioinformatic programs and workflows were built and how to use them to conduct my research. Once I was certified as an instructor, I passed on this knowledge to classrooms of motivated learners whose research is now enhanced because of the experience129. As an instructor-trainer, I learned how to build classrooms where diverse students can learn to the best of their capabilities130\u2013132. Taking all of this together, I have developed a practice of learning through teaching and teaching while learning that helps me adapt what I know to current tasks. This has been especially true for my teaching appointment in biostatistics this final semester of my graduate education. I am using teaching tools from my instructor training kit to create a positive learning environment (code of conduct, minute cards for immediate feedback, live coding, and providing real-world examples) and my practical experience using R to troubleshoot errors and explain concepts. That is what I give to my classroom, but I also gain a lot. I have learned more about hypotheses testing and statistical tests than I thought was possible, and I have been able to implement these approaches into my final workflow, just in time for the culmination of my thesis. My advice to all graduate students is to teach or assist with a statistics course at some point during their training to acquire these valuable skills. As behavioral neuroscientists in search of molecular signatures of memory, it is important to remember that \u201cA mouse cannot tell you if it remembers what it had for breakfast.\u201d I now know how important it is to remember that not all behavioral displays can be easily interpreted, and not all memories manifest themselves with behavior. In practice, this means that multiple measures of activity must be examined in combination to fully characterize it\u2019s behavioral and the neural process that given the expression of that behavior. It is also important that as teachers and mentors, we should not lose sight of the importance of learning and reinforcement as part of their development into scientists and educators of the future. In the same way that conflict training has less effect on gene expression in the hippocampus, so too does consistent reinforcement lead to better learning in the classroom or educational research laboratory. FINAL THOUGHT \u00b6 In conclusion, I hope that the knowledge gained from my thesis research will be used to improve interdisciplinary graduate training programs and to increase the prevalence of reproducible research and open science practices in neuroscience, integrative biology, and beyond.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"conclusion/#conclusion","text":"","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"conclusion/#part-1-scientific-insight","text":"Memory is an instance in which an organism's current behavior is determined by some aspect of its previous experience30.

Even with rapid advances in technology, we still don't understand the genetic and environmental interactions that give rise to complex diseases and behavior with small effect size. Approaches that use behavioral genomics or data science methods to answer questions are often criticized for lacking explicit hypotheses and predictions. Neuroscience experiments are criticized for lacking behaviorally relevant manipulations and being too reductionists. Senior scientists everywhere are saying that inadequate computational training is the most significant impediment to scientific advances. For my thesis, I attempted to overcome all of the problems mentioned above in modern biology to identify molecular links between brain and behavior. The ecosystem surrounding my research was multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional. Because a broad audience my influenced research, I have a strong motivation to write my research for a broad audience. I hope that all my colleagues and future researchers can find a least one thing of use in my body research, whether it be related to a biological phenomena or technical innovation. Before I devolve into the domain-specific details of research and its implications, let me first describe the ecosystem where I worked and thank all the people who have made significant contributions to my growth and development as a scientist. First and foremost, this thesis would not exist without my graduate supervisor, Dr. Hans Hofmann, who in his eternal optimism, always insisted that 'failures' were successes in one shape or form. Though not technically part of my graduate research, the three years I worked as a lab manager in the Hofmann lab (2009-2012) played a defining role in shaping my brain and my view of the world. Lauren O'Connell was an incredible mentor who taught me numerous molecular protocols and gave great advice that jump-started my academic journey. Misha Matz, Carly Kenkle, and Sarah Davis adopted me into their evolutionary genomics journal club where I discovered some of the analytical methods I still use today. Steve Phelps, Kim Hoke, and Ron Oldfield supported my professional development those early years by writing numerous letters of recommendation for travel awards and fellowships. I'll never forget how many great ideas were sparked during the Friday \"Brain, Behavior, and Evolution Seminars\" and the \"Friday Afternoon Rooftop Socials\" which lead to funded research proposals and published papers. Eventually, I enrolled as a graduate student in the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology in the fall of 2012. For the next five years, Rachel Wright was my \"partner-in-crime\" when it came to studying for exams, writing grant proposals, doing yoga, seeing live bands, and navigating life's hurdles. In the classroom, Rick Russel, Jeff Gross, Ruth Buskirk, and Ed Marcotte helped me develop a deep understanding of genetics, molecular biology, systems biology, and evolution that I've carried with me throughout my career. Claus Wilke never formally taught or mentored me, but his online blog and virtual books were a constant information and advice. I am grateful to Vishy Iyer, Andrea Gore, and John Mihic, Nancy Moran for their service on my qualifying examination and thesis proposal committees. The summer of my first year in grad school, Hans introduced me to a beautiful community of neuroscientists that are united by the historic \"Neural Systems and Behavior Course\", which takes place for eight weeks every summer at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole Massachusetts. It was here that I developed my thesis project and gained valuable experience mentoring students. There was undeniable synergy between teaching and doing science in the highly productive Neural Systems and Behavior environment. Proximity to my collaborator was critical for interpreting experimental results while questions from students pushed me to understand my approach even better. I want to thank the other Co-Director and my collaborator, Andr\u00e9 Fenton, for all the wisdom, creativity, and patience he brought to my thesis research projects over the years. I thank Hsin-Yi (Maddy) Kao, Ain Chung, and Juan Marcos Alarcon for their tireless dedication to these collaborative research projects we conducted during the summers of 2013-2016. I think it is incredible that we were able to walk into an empty room and build a laboratory designed specially to carry out the research described in my thesis (Appendix A1). The experiments from the first summer (Appendix B) and second summer were foundational in that they helped us identify strength and weakness of our collaboration. As for teaching, my goal at the Neural Systems and Behavior Course was to build a new 2-week module where students could learn molecular approaches to complement behavioral and electrophysiological methods used in non-traditional species. Primarily, I taught students how to use quantitative real-time PCR and bioinformatics for RNA sequencing analysis1\u20133. I thank David Shultz and Eva Fischer for being a 'shining beacons of humanity' and demonstrating how to foster learning in a molecular biology teaching lab. There are too many to name individually, but I want to thank all the NS&B students, faculty, and staff who spent nearly every waking moment in the laboratory in pursuit of scientific knowledge and discovery. The spring of my second year in graduate school, Hans hired me to be the training and outreach coordinator for the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, and it was here that I met a diverse community of scientists who use and love bioinformatics. I thank all the graduate students who volunteered their time leading the peer-led working groups where I shared our newfound knowledge and helped each other troubleshoot problems in R and Python. I thank Scott Hunicke Smith, Dhivya Arrassappan, Anna Battenhouse, Benni Goetz, and Dennis Wylie for developing the bioinformatic consulting group, which helped me build a strong foundation in data-driven discovery. I especially thank Laurie Alvarez and Nicole Elmer for orchestrating all the social events that brought us together. I'm so grateful April Wright introduced me to the wonderful Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Communities in the winter of 2015 at the exact moment when I needed and wanted it most. I was looking for role models who taught reproducible bioinformatics, and I hit the jackpot. I'm especially grateful to Greg Wilson and Tracy Teal who recognized my potential and opened doors that I didn't even know existed. Kate Hertweck became my constant companion for teaching, mentoring, and organizational governance (sometimes in real life but usually through virtual meetings). Christina Koch, Erin Becker, and Sue McClatchy helped me learn educational pedagogy, which allowed me to start thinking about the science of learning in the classroom and how it relates to the neuromolecular basis of learning and memory. I can't wait to see how the Carpentry communities continue to grow and spread the best-practices for research and teaching to people all around the world. I want to close by thanking the thesis committee members and the Hofmann lab members who have guided me across the finish line. I thank Laura Colgin for the most elegant descriptions and illustrations of how the hippocampus works. I thank Boris Zemelman for keeping me up to date on cutting-edge research in molecular neuroscience. I thank Mikhail Matz always responding to my request for new functions or helping me troubleshoot errors associated with various R packages. Again, I thank Andr\u00e9 Fenton for the wisdom, creativity, patience, and dedication he brought to this research. I want to thank Rebecca Young-Brim, Tessa Solomon Lane, Mariana Rodriguez-Santos, Caitlin Friesen, Eric Brenner, and Isaac Miller-Crews for helping me craft perfect figures at our 'figure it out' meetings and for making the Hofmann lab such a friendly and productive environment. I also feel like its worth thanking all the people I follow on Twitter. Thanks for sharing your stories and tweeting links to cool things. I feel like Twitter gives me access to a world-wide community of scientists, teachers, artists, and writers that give me advice and inspiration for my work. I feel so strongly about connecting with colleagues in geographically diverse places that I even wrote a blog post it . Finally, I want to thank my family, friends, and colleagues who attended my public thesis defense. Your support and insightful comments inspire me to continue exploring scientific unknowns and sharing my findings.","title":"Preface"},{"location":"preface/#preface","text":"This preface describes a personal and professional journey studying the molecular biology of brain function and complex behavior.
